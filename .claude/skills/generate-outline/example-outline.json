But you find the strength you need within yourself. You grip the axe tightly, raise your arm toward the sky with all your might, and hurl the axe at the center of the Tesla coil. The explosion blinds you. “No!” Doctor Claude screams. You run at full speed to the helicopter and climb aboard. Your uncle lifts off. Doctor Claude approaches the Tesla coil, which spins out of control and floods the entire volcano with lightning. With a deafening roar, the TIME CORP base explodes. Your uncle flies the helicopter along the island's coast. You see Thea and her tribe waving goodbye. You see Grumsh waving as well. With a smile, you leave the Island of Time behind.",
