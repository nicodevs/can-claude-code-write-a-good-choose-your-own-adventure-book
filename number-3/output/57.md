Your eyes dart to the battery icon. Three percent. Maybe two minutes of life left.

"The song will play again," you say quickly, letting the translator do its work. "But first—get us down from here."

The Viking considers this. His fingers drum against the axe handle. Then he grins, revealing teeth that have seen better centuries.

"Deal."

One swing of the axe, and the rope snaps. You and Thea tumble to the ground in a heap of limbs and netting. By the time you untangle yourselves, the Viking is already climbing up a rocky path, gesturing impatiently for you to follow.

Minutes later, you stand on a windswept mountaintop beneath a canopy of stars. The jungle sprawls below like a dark ocean. The volcano looms in the distance, its peak glowing faintly with inner fire.

You press play again. The metal roars back to life. The Viking throws his head back and howls at the moon.

For one impossible second, you could swear you see something in the sky. Shapes. Wings. Dragons, silhouetted against the stars?

You blink, and they are gone.

Then your phone dies. The screen goes black. The music cuts to silence.

The Viking turns to you, surprisingly unfazed. He extends one massive hand.

"Grumsh," he says.

You shake it and give him your name. Thea does the same, her grip cautious but respectful.

The first drops of rain begin to fall. Cold and heavy, they splatter against the rocks.

Grumsh grunts and gestures toward a dark shape further along the ridge—a cave, perhaps, or a shelter of some kind.
