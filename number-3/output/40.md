Doctor Claude sighs, as if explaining something obvious to a child.

"Because they were never on this island, Reinald. The Time Blender can select any era we wish, but not the geographic location. It only pulls creatures and people from the immediate surroundings. That is why we brought dinosaurs—this island was crawling with them millions of years ago."

He gestures toward the glass vats, toward the caged creatures, toward the impossible menagerie of prehistoric life.

"If we want Napoleon, we must build a Time Blender in France. If we want Caesar, we need one in Rome. That is why we require more funding." His voice drops to a hiss. "With Time Blenders across the globe, we can conquer the world. Control time itself!"

A chill runs down your spine.

This is not just some mad scientist playing with dinosaurs. This is a plan for world domination. Pull armies from the past. Rewrite history. Bend time to their will.

You have to stop him.

You scan the Lab, searching for something, anything that might help. That is when you spot it—a cage in the corner, smaller than the others. Inside crouches a Troodon, barely three feet tall, its intelligent eyes gleaming in the harsh light. Bandages wrap its hind leg. Electrodes sprout from its skull. This creature has been experimented on. Tortured.

And it looks angry.

If you could reach that cage, release the latch, the Troodon would do the rest. It would tear through this lab like a hurricane, and Doctor Claude would never see it coming.

Or you could ask Thea for her bow. One arrow. One shot. End this now.
