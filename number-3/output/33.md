The canopy opens with a sharp snap. You drift down through the warm tropical air, watching helplessly as your uncle's plane spirals toward the jungle. It disappears behind the trees. A moment later, you hear the crash—metal screaming against wood and stone. A plume of dark smoke rises from the impact site.

You land hard on a sandy beach and roll to a stop. Your hands shake as you unbuckle the harness. The parachute billows behind you like a deflating ghost before settling onto the wet sand.

You pull out your cell phone. No signal. Not a single bar. You hold it up toward the sky, walk in circles, try every trick you know. Nothing.

The jungle looms ahead, thick and dark, swallowing the smoke that rises from the crash site. Somewhere in there is your uncle. Is he hurt? Is he alive? You have to find him.

But then you notice something else. Further down the shore, maybe a hundred meters away, there is an extinguished campfire. Gray ashes. A ring of stones. The remains of a wooden spit. Someone was here—maybe recently.

The jungle calls to you with your uncle's fate. The campfire whispers of possible help, possible rescue.

Which way?
