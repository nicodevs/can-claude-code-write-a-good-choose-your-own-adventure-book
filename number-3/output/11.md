The lightning wraps around your body like burning chains. Every muscle locks. Your bones rattle. The world blurs into white fire and pain.

But somewhere deep inside, you find it. A spark that refuses to die.

Grumsh's words echo through the agony: *May Odin's strength flow through you.*

You grip the axe with everything you have. Your fingers feel distant, numb, but they hold. You force your arm upward, fighting against the current that wants to tear you apart, fighting against gravity itself.

Doctor Claude watches, his death's-head smile faltering. "Impossible," he breathes.

You scream. The sound is raw and primal, ripped from somewhere you did not know existed. With every last shred of strength, you hurl the axe toward the Tesla coil's spinning heart.

The weapon tumbles through the lightning storm, its blade catching the electric fire like a shooting star.

CRASH!

The axe buries itself in the machine's core.

For one heartbeat, nothing happens. Then the Tesla coil shrieks. Sparks explode outward. The lightning recoils, releasing you, whipping back toward its source.

"NO!" Doctor Claude screams.

You do not wait. Your legs move on pure instinct, carrying you across the helipad toward the helicopter. The door is open. Your uncle reaches out, grabs your arm, hauls you inside.

The rotors thunder. The aircraft lurches into the sky.

Behind you, the Tesla coil spins wildly out of control. Lightning floods the helipad, the control room, the entire volcano. Doctor Claude stumbles toward his creation, arms raised as if he could somehow stop the chaos.

Then the TIME CORP base explodes.

The shockwave rocks the helicopter. Your uncle fights the controls, banking hard, pulling away from the expanding fireball. Smoke and debris rain down into the jungle below.

You press your face to the window and watch the island recede. The helicopter follows the coastline, the beach stretching gold beneath you.

There. On the shore. Thea stands with her tribe, their faces turned skyward. She raises her bow in salute, and the others follow, hands lifted in farewell.

Further down the beach, a lone figure waves. Grumsh. His horned helmet gleams in the sunlight. Even from this distance, you swear you can see him grinning.

You wave back, a lump forming in your throat.

The Island of Time grows smaller and smaller, until it is nothing but a dark speck against the endless blue sea. Then even that vanishes.

Your uncle turns to you, exhaustion and relief mingling on his bruised face. "You did it, kid."

You lean back in your seat, Grumsh's blessing still ringing in your ears. The sun warms your face through the cockpit glass.

Somewhere behind you, in a time and place that feels like a dream, a Viking warrior and a girl from the ancient world are finally free. And Doctor Claude's reign of terror is over.

You smile. It is time to go home.

**THE END**
