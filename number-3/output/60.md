The next morning, dawn breaks orange and gold over the jungle canopy. You barely slept, your mind racing with plans and possibilities.

You and your uncle slip into the guards' uniforms. The dark fatigues fit poorly, but they will do. The caps hide your hair. The goggles with built-in night vision cover half your face. You look like TIME CORP soldiers. At least from a distance.

Thea approaches you as you finish strapping on the equipment belt. Her expression is hard to read, but her eyes are soft.

"Come back," she says through the translator. Then she steps forward and hugs you tightly. You feel her heartbeat against your chest, quick and urgent. "Come back safe."

"I will," you promise, though you are not certain you can keep it.

Grumsh waits by the shelter's entrance, his massive frame blocking most of the doorway. As you approach, he reaches down and lifts his axe from its resting place against the wall. The weapon gleams in the morning light, its edge still sharp despite countless battles.

He holds it out to you.

"Take it," the Viking says. "You will need this where you go."

You hesitate. "But this is your weapon. Blessed by Odin himself."

"Odin sent you here for a reason." Grumsh presses the handle into your hands. The axe is heavier than you expected, but it feels right. Solid. Powerful. "May his strength flow through you."

"Thank you, Grumsh."

The Viking nods once. "Kill the evil one. Free my family from wherever he sent them."

You grip the axe tightly and follow your uncle out of the shelter. The volcano looms ahead, its peak wreathed in thin wisps of smoke.
