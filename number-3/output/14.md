There is no time. No time to whisper your plan to Thea. No time to explain what Doctor Claude just said about time travel, about conquering the world, about her people being ripped from their own century. You have to act now.

You reach toward Thea's quiver and pull out an arrow. Her eyes widen, but before she can react, you grab the bow from her shoulder and spring to your feet.

"It's over, Claude!" you shout, your voice echoing through the Lab.

Every head turns. Every worker freezes. Doctor Claude spins around, his black goggles catching the harsh fluorescent light. His thin lips part in surprise.

"What?" he rasps.

You draw the bowstring back—or try to. Your arms shake. The arrow wobbles. You remember that tournament with your friends three summers ago. Third place out of five contestants. Not exactly Robin Hood.

You release.

The arrow drops to the floor two feet in front of you, clattering harmlessly against the stone.

Doctor Claude stares at it. Then at you. A skeletal grin spreads across his face.

"Guards," he says calmly.

A shot rings out. The last thing you see is Thea's horrified face, her hand reaching for an arrow she will never get to fire.

Third place. You should have practiced more.

**THE END**
