You carefully lift the edge of the tarp and peek out.

Your breath catches.

You are inside a gigantic cavern carved into the heart of the volcano. The ceiling soars hundreds of feet overhead, studded with industrial lights that bathe everything in harsh white glare. Heavy machinery lines the walls—generators, hydraulic presses, things you cannot even begin to identify. Cables thick as tree trunks snake across the stone floor.

And the glass vats. Dozens of them, each one the size of a small house, filled with viscous green liquid that bubbles and churns. Shadows move inside them—shapes that might be limbs, tails, teeth.

But the cages are what make your stomach turn.

They stretch in rows across the cavern floor, each one holding a dinosaur. You recognize a Triceratops, its horns dulled and chipped, pacing in tight circles. Oviraptors huddle together in another pen, their feathered bodies trembling. A pterodactyl hangs from the ceiling of its enclosure, wings folded, eyes dead.

A logo is stamped on every surface. The cages. The machinery. The uniforms of the workers hurrying past. Two words in bold black letters:

TIME CORP.

Footsteps echo across the cavern. You duck back beneath the tarp, heart pounding.

Through the gap, you watch a figure approach. Skeletal. Hunched. Long white hair falling past bony shoulders. He wears gray clothes that hang loose on his emaciated frame, and black goggles cover his eyes, making him look less like a man and more like some ancient insect.

The workers stop what they are doing. They bow.

This is the boss. The man in charge. The reason dinosaurs walk this island.

He passes close to your hiding spot, close enough that you can hear his wheezing breath, then disappears through a doorway marked LABORATORY.

You scan the cavern. Two corridors branch off from the main chamber. One leads to the Lab—you can see gleaming equipment through the windows, and that skeletal figure moving among them. The other is marked RADIO ROOM.

A radio. You could call for help. You could warn the outside world.

Or you could follow the boss and learn what he is really doing here.

Thea meets your eyes. She is ready for whatever you decide.
