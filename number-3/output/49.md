Inside the volcano, chaos reigns.

Alarms blare. Red lights flash along metal corridors. TIME CORP henchmen pour from side doors, only to be met by Thea's warriors flooding in behind you. The clash of steel, the crack of gunfire, the screams of the wounded—it all blurs together into a nightmare of sound and fury.

You fight your way forward, ducking behind crates, scrambling up stairwells. Thea stays at your side, her bow singing death with every draw. An arrow takes a guard in the knee. Another in the hand. She does not kill unless she must.

Up. Always up. The Control Room is at the top—that is what the captured guards told you. That is where you will find Doctor Claude.

You burst through a final door and stumble onto a wide bridge.

Pure metal stretches before you, spanning the volcano's open caldera. Below, molten lava churns and bubbles, casting everything in hellish orange light. The heat is suffocating, pressing against you like a physical force.

And there, at the far end of the bridge, stands a figure.

An old man. Skeletal thin, with white hair that floats in the rising thermals. Gray clothes hang loose on his frame. Black goggles cover his eyes, reflecting the lava's glow like twin mirrors into oblivion.

Doctor Claude.

He sees you. A thin smile crosses his lips. Then he turns and runs, his coat billowing behind him.

"Stop!" you shout.

But he does not stop. Instead, he pulls a remote control from his pocket and presses a button.

In the middle of the bridge, a Tesla coil crackles to life. Electricity arcs between twin towers, blue and blinding. The lava below surges, bubbling and frothing as if something massive is rising from its depths.

Then the air splits apart.

A shape emerges from the lightning—enormous, impossible. Scales the color of dried blood. Teeth like curved daggers. Arms so small they would be comical if the rest of the creature were not so terrifying.

A tyrannosaurus rex. Forty feet of prehistoric fury, standing between you and Doctor Claude.

"Monster!" Thea breathes in her ancient tongue.

The T-Rex lowers its head. Its nostrils flare. Those tiny eyes fix on you with predatory intelligence.

Your mind races. You cannot let Claude escape. But how do you get past a T-Rex? Those massive legs, that crushing jaw... Wait. Those legs. There is a gap between them. If you could run fast enough, time it perfectly...

But you would need a distraction. Something to draw its attention away, even for a second.

Or maybe you should fall back. Find another route. Live to fight another way.
