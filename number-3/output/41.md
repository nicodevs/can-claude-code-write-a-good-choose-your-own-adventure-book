You follow Thea through the jungle, the translation app working overtime as she points out dangers and shortcuts. After an hour of walking, the trees thin out, and you see it—a village nestled in a wide clearing.

About a hundred people live here, their homes simple huts built from wood and palm fronds. Children play between the structures while adults weave baskets, sharpen tools, and tend to cooking fires. Everyone wears the same rough burlap clothing as Thea, many with similar red paint around their eyes.

They stare as you enter. Whispers ripple through the crowd. Thea speaks rapidly to an older woman, who nods and gestures for you to follow.

You spend the next hour meeting the tribe. Through your phone, you learn their history—or what they know of it. The elders speak of a great plain where their ancestors once lived, a land of endless grass and giant beasts. Then came the lightning.

"It struck from a clear sky," an old man explains, his weathered face serious. "Our founders were hunting when the light swallowed them. When they opened their eyes, they were here. On this island."

You do the math in your head. Proto-Indo-European speakers. Lightning from nowhere. Could they have been transported through time? The thought seems insane, but so does everything else on this island.

That evening, you share a meal with Thea's family—roasted vegetables, fish caught from the shore, and a sweet drink made from jungle fruit. As the fire crackles, Thea leads you to the edge of the village.

"Come," she says. "I want to show you something."
