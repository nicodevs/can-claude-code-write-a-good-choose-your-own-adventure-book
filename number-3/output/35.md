You pull out your phone and open the translation app. Thankfully, you downloaded the offline universal translator last summer—a quirky app that claims to handle over five hundred languages, including extinct ones. You never thought you would actually need it.

You hold the phone toward the girl and tap record. She speaks again, her words flowing in that strange, ancient rhythm.

The app processes for a moment. Then text appears on screen:

_Language detected: Proto-Indo-European dialect (unclassified variant). Confidence: 87%._

Your jaw drops. Proto-Indo-European? That language has been dead for thousands of years. How is that possible?

But the translation follows: _"Danger. Beast nearby. Carnivore. We must hide."_

You look up at the girl. Her eyes are still fixed on the jungle, scanning the treeline with practiced wariness. TODO

"My name is..." you begin, then tap the translate button and let the app convert your words into her dialect. The phone speaks in those musical tones.

Her eyebrows rise. A small smile crosses her face—the first crack in her intense demeanor.

She points to herself. "Thea."

You explain about your uncle, the crash, how you need to find him. The app works both ways now, a strange bridge across millennia.

"Come to my tribe," Thea says through the translator. "We have medicine. If your uncle is hurt, we can help."

You hesitate. "We might not have time for that. The plane had a first aid kit. If it survived the crash, that might be enough."

Thea nods slowly, understanding the urgency in your voice. "I will help you," she says. "Whatever you choose."

- _If you ask her to help you search for your uncle first, turn to [page 52](./52.md)_
