Thea leads the way through the jungle, following trails only she can see. The journey takes hours, but eventually the trees thin and you find yourself standing at the edge of a hidden valley.

Your jaw drops.

A village sprawls before you—thatched huts, cooking fires, children playing in the dust. But that is not what steals your breath.

Dinosaurs. Everywhere.

They wander among the people like cattle in a pasture. Gentle giants with long necks browse on treetops. Smaller creatures with crested heads drink from a stream. A group of children chase what looks like a feathered raptor, laughing as it dodges their grasping hands.

"You did not tell me you had dinosaurs as pets," you say, unsure whether the translator captures what you mean.

Thea glances back at you with a hint of a smile. "I told you there were monsters on the island. These are not monsters. They are friends."

You look closer and realize the truth. Every dinosaur here is an herbivore. Plant-eaters. The village has somehow tamed them, made them part of daily life.

A pair of Dryosaurus trot past, sleek and fast, with riders on their backs. They move like horses—no, faster than horses. The riders whoop and holler as they race toward the far end of the valley.

"You ride them?" you ask, incredulous.

"Of course," Thea says. "Want to learn?"

An hour later, you are clinging to the back of a Dryosaurus named Whistle, your knuckles white against its feathered mane. The ground blurs beneath you. Wind whips tears from your eyes. You never imagined riding a dinosaur, but here you are, racing across an ancient valley on an island that should not exist.

For one glorious moment, you forget about TIME CORP. You forget about the danger. You just ride.
