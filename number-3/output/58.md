You spin on your heel and run. Back toward the door. Back toward safety. Back toward anywhere that is not here, on a bridge above molten lava, with a tyrannosaurus rex between you and a madman.

"Wait!" Thea shouts behind you. But you are already moving, legs pumping, lungs burning in the sulfurous air.

The door. You can see it. Twenty feet away. Fifteen. Ten.

You slam into it with your shoulder.

It does not budge.

Locked. Sealed. Someone on the other side must have thrown the deadbolt when the alarms started. A security measure. A trap.

You pound your fists against the metal. "Open up! Let me in!"

No answer. Only the blaring of alarms and the rumble of the volcano.

Then you feel it. A vibration through the bridge. Footsteps. Massive footsteps.

You turn slowly.

The T-Rex stands five feet away, its head lowered, those ancient eyes studying you with something like curiosity. Steam rises from its nostrils. Its breath washes over you, hot and rank with the smell of meat.

Behind it, far across the bridge, you see Doctor Claude watching. He raises one hand in a mocking wave.

The tyrannosaurus opens its jaws.

Turns out running from a T-Rex was a bad idea. Who would have thought?

**THE END**
