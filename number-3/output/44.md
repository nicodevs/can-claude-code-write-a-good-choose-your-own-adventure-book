You back away slowly, keeping your eyes on the small dinosaur. Your uncle comes first. Whatever impossible thing you just witnessed, it can wait.

You slip into the underbrush and circle wide around the river, giving the creature a generous berth. Your heart pounds the entire time. A dinosaur. An actual dinosaur. Part of you wants to scream. Another part wants to laugh. But you force yourself to focus.

Hours pass. The jungle seems endless—a maze of green shadows and twisted roots. You follow broken branches, scorched leaves, anything that might mark the plane's path. Sweat drips into your eyes. Your legs ache. The sun climbs higher, then begins its slow descent toward the horizon.

Finally, you spot something glinting through the trees. Metal.

You push through a wall of ferns and find the wreckage. The plane lies crumpled against a massive tree trunk, its nose buried in the earth, one wing torn completely off. Debris scatters the jungle floor in a long trail—luggage, papers, chunks of fuselage.

"Uncle!" you shout, scrambling over the wreckage.

A weak groan answers you. You find him slumped against a rock, clutching his side. His face is pale, streaked with dirt and dried blood from a gash on his forehead. But he is alive.

"Took you long enough," he says with a pained smile.

You kneel beside him. His leg is twisted at an odd angle, and he winces when he tries to move.

"The emergency raft," he says, nodding toward a yellow bundle half-buried under debris. "Help me inflate it before nightfall. We can use it to escape."

You glance at the darkening sky. There is so much you want to tell him. About the creature at the river. About this impossible island. But maybe now is not the time.

Or maybe he needs to know.
