"I can make it," you say, already wading into the water. "I'm a strong swimmer."

Thea calls out something—a warning, maybe—but you are already pushing off from the riverbed. The current hits you like a fist. Cold. Fast. Far stronger than it looked from the shore.

You kick hard, arms slicing through the water, but the river has other plans. It spins you, drags you, pulls you downstream like a leaf in a storm. Your feet search for the bottom and find nothing but churning darkness.

You gasp for air. Water fills your mouth. The shore races past—Thea's figure growing smaller, her shouts swallowed by the roar.

Then you see it.

Something massive rises from the water ahead. A reptilian head, jaws lined with teeth like serrated knives. You know this beast. You have seen it a hundred times on Dino Quest, rendered in careful CGI. Allosaurus. A killing machine from the Jurassic period.

But this one is not CGI. This one is real, and it is looking right at you.

You grab desperately at a passing branch. It snaps in your hand like a wishbone.

The current pushes you forward, straight into those waiting jaws.

Dozens of teeth, sharp as daggers, close around you. At least you know exactly which species got you. Science accurate.

**THE END**
