They lead you inside, through corridors of humming machinery and blinking lights. Scientists in white coats hurry past without a glance. The hum grows louder, deeper, until it vibrates in your bones.

Then you enter a vast chamber, and your heart nearly stops.

Two metal platforms stand at the center, surrounded by Tesla coils that crackle with arcs of electricity. The air smells of ozone and something else. Something burned.

The guards shove you and your uncle onto the platforms and strap you down with thick leather restraints.

"You know," says a voice, thin and cold, "for now we can only bring creatures from the past to the present."

An old man steps into view. His hair is white as bone. His skin stretches tight over a skeletal frame. Black goggles cover his eyes, reflecting the dancing electricity like twin dark mirrors.

"Every time we try to send a creature from the present to the past, there are... accidents." TODO

He gestures to a platform beside yours. On it lies a body, charred beyond recognition. Your stomach lurches as you realize—that is your uncle. They already tested this on him. They strapped him down when you were not looking. And now he is gone.

"I wonder if you will endure," the old man says.

He pulls a lever.

The Tesla coils roar to life. Lightning engulfs your body. Your scream is swallowed by thunder.

Then everything vanishes.

You open your eyes.

Red sky. Barren rock. No jungle. No volcano. No sound at all. You try to breathe, but there is nothing to breathe. Your lungs burn. Your vision darkens.

You look up at that ancient crimson sky, and you understand. You have been sent back. Far, far back. Before the dinosaurs. Before anything. Before life itself.

The red sky is the last thing you see.

No one ever knew how life arose on planet Earth. And no one will ever guess what became of your decomposing body, scattered across primordial stone four billion years ago.

You were the first living being on Earth. And in a way, we all descend from you.

**THE END**
