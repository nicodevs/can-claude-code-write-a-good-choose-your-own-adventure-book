The rain comes down harder now, cold sheets that sting your skin. You and Thea follow Grumsh along the rocky ridge, scrambling to keep up with his massive strides. Lightning flashes in the distance, illuminating the volcano's silhouette against the angry sky.

Grumsh leads you to a wooden shelter nestled against the mountainside—a rough construction of logs, leaves, and salvaged debris. It is not pretty, but it is dry.

"Home," Grumsh announces, ducking through the entrance.

Inside, the shelter is surprisingly cozy. A straw bed sits in one corner, rumpled and well-used. Improvised weapons line the walls: spears tipped with sharpened stone, clubs wrapped in leather, a fishing net woven from jungle vines. The remains of a campfire smolder in a pit near the center.

Grumsh crouches by the fire and begins coaxing it back to life with dried moss and gentle breaths.

Your eyes wander across the odd collection of items scattered about. Bones. Feathers. Rough clay pots. And then—something that does not belong.

A modern backpack.

It sits in the corner, sleek and black, utterly out of place among the primitive surroundings. You step closer and see a patch stitched to the side: a lightning bolt inside a gear. Beneath it, three words: TIME CORP.

"That," Grumsh says, noticing your interest. "Found it on a dead man. On a trail near the volcano. Strange clothes. Strange tools." TODO

Your hands tremble as you unzip the pack. Inside, you find a water bottle, some energy bars, a compass—and a power bank. A fully charged power bank.

Your dead phone suddenly feels like the most important thing in the world.
