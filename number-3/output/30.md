"Now!" your uncle hisses.

You burst from cover, sprinting toward the truck as it slows for the entrance. Your uncle takes the driver's side. You take the passenger's. The element of surprise is everything.

You wrench the door open. The man inside—gray uniform, buzz cut, eyes wide with shock—barely has time to react before you grab his collar and yank him sideways. He tumbles out of the cab with a strangled yelp.

On the other side, you hear the sounds of struggle. Your uncle grappling with the driver. Grunts. The thud of fists against flesh.

But something goes wrong.

The truck lurches forward. Tires scream against volcanic rock. The man you pulled from the cab scrambles to his feet, already reaching for something at his belt—a radio, a weapon, you cannot tell.

"Uncle!" you shout.

You see him lose his footing. His injured leg buckles. He slips, still clinging to the driver's door, and then—

The truck accelerates.

Your uncle disappears beneath the wheels.

There is a sickening thud. The crunch of bone. A sound you will never forget for as long as you live.

"NO!"

You freeze. One heartbeat. Two. Long enough for the passenger to swing a crowbar at the back of your skull.

Pain explodes through your head. The world tilts. You see the titanium doors closing, the caged Parasaurolophus watching with mournful eyes, and then—

Nothing.
