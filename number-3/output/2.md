You connect the power bank to your phone with shaking hands. The screen flickers. The battery icon appears: ten percent. Fifteen. Twenty.

You could cry with relief.

Grumsh gets the fire crackling properly, and you all huddle around its warmth. The flames cast dancing shadows on the walls as rain drums against the shelter's roof.

"How did you get here?" you ask Grumsh, the translator app working once more. "To this island?"

The Viking's face darkens. He stares into the fire for a long moment.

"I came with my people," he says at last. "Warriors. Explorers. We sailed for months, seeking new lands. Then we found this island." He pauses. "We made camp on the shore. Built fires. Planned to explore the next day."

"What happened?"

"Lightning." His voice drops to a whisper. "A bolt from a clear sky. Brighter than any storm. It struck the beach, and when my eyes cleared..." He shakes his head. "Everyone was gone. My brothers. My wife. Vanished. Only I remained."

The fire pops and hisses.

"The gods took them," Grumsh continues. "This island is cursed. Odin tests me here, alone, against these demon lizards." TODO

You wonder if that is what happened to your uncle. A bolt of lightning. Disappearing.

Then Thea speaks, her voice soft through the translator. "A lightning bolt? The legend says my people came to this island in a bolt of lightning. That is how they founded my village, centuries ago."

You stare at her. Centuries?

Before you can ask more, a sound cuts through the rain. A low rumble. Footsteps. Heavy. Getting closer.

Then a roar splits the night.

Grumsh seizes his axe and rushes to the entrance. You scramble after him.

There, at the edge of the firelight, stands a nightmare.

A dinosaur. Alive. Massive and muscular, standing on two powerful legs. Its hide is striped like a tiger's, dark bands rippling across gray-green scales. Rows of serrated teeth gleam in the flickering light.

Your mind races through every episode of Dino Quest. That jaw structure. Those proportions. The distinctive coloring.

A torvosaurus gurneyi. Thirty feet of prehistoric predator, and it is staring right at you.
