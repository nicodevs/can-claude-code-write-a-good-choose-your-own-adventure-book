You turn away from the campfire and plunge into the jungle. Your uncle needs you. That is all that matters.

The vegetation swallows you within seconds. Thick ferns brush against your legs. Vines hang from twisted trees like green curtains. The air is heavy, humid, filled with the buzz of insects and the distant calls of birds you cannot identify. You push forward, following the direction of the smoke, hoping the crash site is not too far.

After several minutes of hacking through the undergrowth, you stumble upon a river. Crystal-clear water flows over smooth stones, catching the dappled sunlight that filters through the canopy above. You pause to catch your breath. Maybe you should drink something. You have been sweating since the moment you landed.

Then you see it.

At the river's edge, a small creature is drinking. At first glance, it looks like a lizard—green, scaly, about two feet long. But then it stands up. On two legs. It turns its head, and you see the unmistakable shape: the elongated snout, the tiny arms, the thick tail balancing its body.

Your heart stops.

That is not a lizard. That is a dinosaur. A living, breathing dinosaur.

Is this real? How can this be possible? You have watched every episode of Dino Quest, memorized every species, every fact. But those were bones and computer animations. This creature is flesh and blood, standing twenty feet away from you.

It has not noticed you yet. You reach slowly for your phone. You have no signal, but the camera still works. If you could capture this on video, you would have proof. Proof of something impossible. Something world-changing.

But your uncle is out there, maybe hurt, maybe worse. Every minute counts.

The dinosaur bends down to drink again. It seems calm. Small. Probably harmless.
