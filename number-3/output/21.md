Darkness falls over the island like a shroud. You mount Whistle, feeling the Dryosaurus's muscles tense beneath you. Thea climbs onto her own mount, a gray-feathered beast called Storm. Beside you, a dozen tribal warriors sit astride their dinosaurs, spears and bows at the ready.

"Stay close," Thea whispers. "The guards change shifts at midnight. That is when we strike."

You nod, your heart hammering against your ribs.

The group moves in silence through the jungle, following a path that skirts the volcano's base. The air grows warmer as you approach, thick with the smell of sulfur. Through gaps in the canopy, you glimpse the mountain's peak—a red glow pulses from within, like the heartbeat of some slumbering giant.

Then you see it. The TIME CORP base.

Metal platforms jut from the volcanic rock like parasites. Floodlights sweep the perimeter. Guards patrol catwalks, their rifles glinting in the harsh light. A massive steel door leads into the mountainside itself.

Thea raises her fist. The group halts.

You watch the guards. Count them. Five on the outer platform. Two more by the door. Their movements are lazy, bored. They do not expect an attack.

Midnight comes.

Thea's arm drops. Warriors surge forward.

Arrows fly through the night, silent and deadly. Two guards fall before they can raise an alarm. The others scramble for their weapons, but Whistle is already charging, closing the distance in seconds. You duck low against the dinosaur's neck as gunfire cracks overhead.

The tribal warriors swarm the platform. Steel clashes against stone. Shouts echo off the volcano walls.

"Inside!" Thea yells. "Go!"

You leap from Whistle's back and sprint for the steel door. A guard lunges at you, but a warrior's spear catches him in the shoulder. He goes down screaming.

The door is open. You plunge into the mountain.
