"Now!" Thea hisses.

You both sprint from your hiding spot behind the boulder. The truck has slowed to pass through the titanium doors, its cargo bed open and inviting. Thea reaches it first, grabbing the metal frame and pulling herself up with the grace of a jungle cat. You scramble after her, your sneakers slipping on the bumper before you find purchase.

The cage dominates the truck bed. Inside, the Parasaurolophus shifts weakly, its head drooping. Up close, you can see the creature is sick—its scales are dull, its eyes clouded, its breathing shallow and labored. A low, mournful sound escapes its throat.

"Shh," Thea whispers, pressing her palm against the cage bars. "Shh, friend."

The dinosaur falls silent, as if understanding.

You spot a pile of tattered blankets and canvas tarps shoved into the corner of the truck bed—probably used to cover the cage during transport. Perfect. You and Thea crawl beneath them, pressing yourselves flat against the cold metal floor.

The truck lurches forward. The engine rumbles. Through a gap in the fabric, you watch the titanium doors slide shut behind you with a heavy clang.

You are inside.

The truck bounces over uneven ground for what feels like an eternity. Then it stops. Doors slam. Footsteps approach. Voices bark orders in clipped, military tones.

Metal groans. The cage shudders and begins to rise—some kind of crane or pulley system lifting it off the truck. You and Thea stay frozen beneath the rags, barely breathing.

Then the movement stops. The voices fade. Silence.
