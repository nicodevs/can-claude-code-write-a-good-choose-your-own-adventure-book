Inside the backpack, beneath the power bank and energy bars, you find a folded piece of paper. You spread it out on the ground, and your breath catches.

A map of the island.

Every detail is marked with precision—the coastline, the rivers, the jungle, the volcano at the center. But two markers catch your eye immediately. One in the north. One in the south. Both show the same symbol: a pair of towers connected by jagged lines. Lightning bolts. Beside each marker, a label reads: TIME BLENDER.

You stare at those words. Time Blender.

"Grumsh said he was exploring this island," you whisper, "and that a lightning strike made his people disappear. But in reality, the lightning made him... travel through time. The Time Blender took him out of his era to ours!"

Your uncle's eyes widen. "That would explain the dinosaurs. These machines bring them from the past to the present."

"And the same goes for Thea and her tribe," you add. "They speak a language that's been dead for thousands of years. Because they came from thousands of years ago."

The pieces fall into place like a terrible puzzle. The malfunctioning plane. The volcanic island that appears on no maps. The prehistoric predators roaming freely.

"We have to find out who's behind this," your uncle says, his voice grim. "I would bet they are the ones who caused our plane to crash."

"Very clever," says a voice behind you.

You spin around. Two men stand at the shelter's entrance, rifles trained on you. Rain drips from their black tactical gear. On their jackets, illuminated by the dying firelight, you see the same lightning-bolt logo from the backpack.

TIME CORP.

"Freeze," one of them orders. "Both of you. Hands where we can see them."
