You ride with Grumsh and a dozen warriors through the jungle, weaving between ancient trees and leaping over tangled roots. Whistle moves beneath you like an extension of your own body, responding to your every shift in weight.

The first Time Blender rises from a clearing like a steel nightmare—a gigantic Tesla coil wrapped in cables and scaffolding, reaching toward the sky like a mechanical finger. It stands silent now, dormant. No lightning crackles along its surface. No temporal storms rage around its base.

Guards patrol the perimeter. Four of them. They do not expect an attack.

Grumsh signals with his hand. The warriors fan out through the underbrush, silent as ghosts.

Then Grumsh roars.

He charges from the treeline, axe raised high, blond hair streaming behind him. The guards spin, fumbling for their weapons. Too slow. The Viking is among them before the first shot fires.

You leap from Whistle's back and sprint toward the control unit—a metal box bristling with dials and switches. Your fingers find the access panel and wrench it open.

Inside, a tangle of cables pulses with dormant energy. Reds, blues, yellows, all feeding into the coil's central core.

"A short circuit would ruin it forever," you murmur, remembering something from a science documentary. You grab a handful of wires and start cutting. Then you reconnect them at random—red to blue, yellow to red, blue to yellow.

"Everyone move back!" you shout. "Get clear!"

The warriors retreat. Grumsh gives you one long look, then nods and falls back with the others.

You stand alone before the machine.

Your hand finds the activation lever. You do not hesitate.

CRACK!

Lightning explodes from the coil. White-hot bolts engulf you, searing through your body like fire and ice combined. You scream, but the sound is lost in the roar of temporal energy.

The coil shudders. Sparks fountain into the sky. Then the whole structure detonates in a cascade of light and metal.

You feel it—time itself tearing at you. Memories flutter away like pages in a storm. The village. Thea's smile. Grumsh's laughter around the campfire. Your uncle's face when he found you in the rain. All of it fading, dissolving, slipping through your fingers like sand.

When you open your eyes, you are lying on a beach.

The sun is warm. Waves lap at the shore. Your parachute billows nearby, tangled in the sand.

You sit up slowly, confused. Where are you? How did you get here?

A column of smoke rises from the jungle in the distance. Something crashed there. You should... you should check it out.

You stand and brush the sand from your clothes. Your head aches. Your memories feel hollow, like rooms from which the furniture has been removed.

Something important happened here. You are sure of it.

But you cannot remember what.

**THE END**
