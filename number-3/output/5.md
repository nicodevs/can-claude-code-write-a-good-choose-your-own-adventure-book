"You go first," Thea says through the translator, nocking an arrow to her bow. "I will cover you."

You take a deep breath and step onto the first plank. It groans under your weight. The ropes bite into your palms as you grip them tight. Do not look down. Whatever you do, do not look down. TODO

You look down.

The river rages thirty feet below, white foam crashing against jagged rocks. Your stomach lurches. You force your eyes forward and keep moving. One plank. Another. The bridge sways with every step, and you feel the wind tugging at your clothes like invisible hands trying to pull you off.

Halfway across.

CRACK!

The plank beneath your right foot splinters and falls away. You lunge forward, grabbing the rope railing as your legs dangle over nothing. The whole bridge shudders. Another plank breaks loose. Then another.

"Hold on!" Thea screams.

The bridge collapses.

You plummet. Your hands find the rope at the last second, and you slam hard against the hillside. Pain explodes through your shoulder. The impact knocks the breath from your lungs, but you hold on. You hold on with everything you have.

Below you, movement.

You crane your neck and see them emerging from the undergrowth at the base of the cliff. Four creatures. Sleek, muscular bodies covered in mottled scales. Long snouts filled with teeth. Curved claws that gouge the earth as they move.

Dinosaurs. Living, breathing dinosaurs.

Utahraptors. The name surfaces from countless episodes of Dino Quest. Apex predators. Pack hunters. Smarter than they have any right to be.

And they are climbing toward you.
