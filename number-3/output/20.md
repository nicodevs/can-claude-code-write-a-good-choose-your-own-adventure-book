Your heart nearly stops.

Dinosaurs. Living, breathing dinosaurs.

"We call them the gentle ones," Thea says through the translator. "They eat plants. They help us carry heavy loads."

You step closer, gripping the fence. A massive herbivore—something like a Parasaurolophus, with its distinctive curved crest—leans down and sniffs your hair. Its breath is warm and smells like crushed leaves.

"This is impossible," you whisper, but the creature's nose bumps your shoulder, very much real.

You spend an entire day with the tribe, learning their ways, helping where you can. An elder named Koru prepares a special medicine from jungle herbs—something to help with wounds and fever.

"For your uncle," he says, pressing a leather pouch into your hands.

You are ready to leave, to finally search for the crash site, when the sky darkens without warning. Wind tears through the village, ripping at the huts. Thunder rolls across the island like the roar of some ancient beast.

"Typhoon!" Thea shouts over the howling gale. "Inside! Now!"

Rain slams down in sheets so thick you can barely see your own hands. The storm has come, and it is not leaving anytime soon.
