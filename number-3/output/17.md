"We need rest," your uncle says, wincing as he adjusts his bandaged leg. "And I want to know what's really going on in that mountain."

Thea nods in agreement. "My people say the bad things come from there. If we want to stop them, we must see for ourselves."

You take turns keeping watch through the night. The jungle never truly sleeps—strange calls echo through the darkness, and twice you hear something large moving through the undergrowth nearby. But nothing attacks. When dawn finally breaks, gray light filtering through the canopy, you feel almost rested.

Your uncle tests his leg. The swelling has gone down, and whatever Thea put on the wound seems to be working. He can walk, slowly, with a branch for support.

"Let's move," he says.

The three of you set off toward the volcano. The terrain grows steeper as you climb, the jungle thinning into rocky slopes dotted with scraggly bushes. Steam vents hiss from cracks in the ground, filling the air with the smell of sulfur.

Then Thea holds up her fist. Stop.

You crouch behind a boulder and peer over the edge. What you see makes your breath catch.

A fortified entrance. Massive double doors made of gleaming titanium, almost hidden among the foliage and volcanic rock. Around it, coils of barbed wire glint in the morning sun. Metal fences—definitely electrified, judging by the warning signs—form a perimeter. This is no ancient ruin. This is a military installation.

"What is this place?" you whisper.

Before anyone can answer, the rumble of an engine reaches your ears. A 4x4 truck appears along a hidden road, bouncing over rocks and roots. The titanium doors grind open to receive it.

In the cab sit two men wearing gray uniforms. But it is the cargo that makes your jaw drop.

A cage. And inside the cage, a dinosaur.

A Parasaurolophus. You recognize the distinctive curved crest from Dino Quest. The creature honks mournfully, pressing against the bars as the truck rolls through the entrance.

The doors begin to close.

Your uncle grabs your shoulder. "We need a plan," he hisses. "Fast."
