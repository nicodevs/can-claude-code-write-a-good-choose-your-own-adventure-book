"Run!" Grumsh bellows, raising his axe.

But you shake your head. "It's pointless! That thing would catch us before we made it ten steps."

The torvosaurus takes another step forward, its massive claws gouging the wet earth. Rain sizzles against its hide. Those terrible eyes fix on you, calculating, hungry.

"Fire," you say. "Fire should scare it away."

Without losing another second, you spin around and grab a burning log from the campfire. Sparks scatter as you raise it high like a torch, the flames licking the night air. You swing it from side to side, mimicking the movements of a sword.

The torvosaurus halts.

Its nostrils flare. Its eyes track the dancing flame. For one breathless moment, the beast simply watches, uncertain.

Then Thea is at your side. Her hands move fast, tearing a strip of cloth from her tunic. She wraps it around the tip of an arrow, then thrusts the bundle into the campfire until it catches.

She nocks the flaming arrow, draws the bow, and fires.

The arrow streaks through the rain like a comet and strikes the dinosaur square in the shoulder. The beast shrieks—a sound like tearing metal—and stumbles backward.

"Well done!" Grumsh roars. He snatches an ember the size of a coconut from the fire pit, ignoring the heat that must be searing his palm, and hurls it at the torvosaurus like a bomb. It explodes against the creature's flank in a shower of sparks.

The torvosaurus retreats another step. Then another. Its eyes dart between the three of you, weighing the threat.

But you can see it in those ancient, calculating eyes. You have not won. You have only bought time.

The beast lowers its head. Its lips peel back, revealing rows of serrated teeth. A low growl rumbles from its chest.

Then it starts trotting toward you, jaws wide open.
