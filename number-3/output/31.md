The guards exchange nervous glances. The firelight flickers across their pale faces.

"We're just soldiers," one of them stammers. "We follow orders. That's all."

"Whose orders?" you press.

A long pause. Then: "Doctor Claude."

The name hangs in the air like smoke. Your uncle's jaw tightens.

"He runs everything," the other guard admits, his voice shaking. "TIME CORP. The island. The Time Blenders. All of it. He's been working on time travel for decades. Obsessed with it."

"Why?" you ask. "What does he want?"

The guard laughs bitterly. "Control. If you can pull things from the past into the present, you can pull anything. Armies. Weapons. Monsters." He swallows hard. "And once he perfects the technology, he'll build Time Blenders all over the world. Whoever controls time controls everything."

You feel cold despite the fire's warmth. Dinosaurs roaming free. People ripped from their homes across centuries. All because one man wanted power.

"For now, the machines only work here," the first guard continues. "Something about this island's electromagnetic field. Doctor Claude doesn't understand it fully, but he's close. Very close."

"Where is he?" your uncle demands.

"Inside the volcano. That's where the main base is. The control room. Everything."

Thea steps forward, her expression hard. She heard enough through the translator. "We must stop him," she says. "This man stole my ancestors from their time. He brought the demon lizards that killed my people's hunters."

Grumsh grips his axe. "And he brought me here. Took my family." His voice is a low growl. "I will have vengeance."

You all look at one another. Four strangers from different times, united by a common enemy.

"There are two ways in," your uncle says, studying the map. "Thea could rally her tribe for a direct assault. Or we could sneak in through the helipad entrance. They have a helicopter there, and I know how to fly one." TODO
