You shake your head. You have wasted too much time already. Your uncle is out there somewhere, possibly hurt, possibly dying. You cannot afford to follow a Viking into a cave while the rain comes down.

"I have to find my uncle," you say.

Grumsh tilts his head, not understanding. Without the translator, your words are just noise. You mime a plane crashing, point toward the jungle, tap your chest.

He shrugs and turns toward his shelter. His message is clear: suit yourself.

Thea steps forward and says something. Her voice is soft, almost pleading. But without your phone, her words are just sounds, ancient and meaningless. She reaches for your arm, but you pull away.

"I'm sorry," you say. "I have to go."

You turn and start back down the path. The rain hammers against your shoulders, cold and relentless. Behind you, Thea calls out once more, then falls silent. She does not follow.

The jungle swallows you. The winding path descends the hillside, slick with mud and rainwater. You move fast, too fast, driven by guilt and desperation. The crash site cannot be far. You are sure of it.

Lightning cracks across the sky, illuminating the trees for one blinding instant.

Your foot slips.

You reach for a branch, a vine, anything. Your fingers close on empty air. The world tilts sideways, and then there is only falling, tumbling, a sharp explosion of pain as your head strikes something hard.

You never feel the ground. You never see the morning. And when a family of velociraptors discovers you at dawn, you are in no position to object to breakfast.

**THE END**
