You run. Down corridors you do not recognize. Past rooms filled with machines and monitors. Through a maintenance tunnel that smells like sulfur and rust. Thea knows how to move—how to duck, how to weave, how to vanish into shadows when the guards get too close.

Somehow, impossibly, you make it out.

You burst through a ventilation shaft and tumble onto the rocky slope outside the volcano. The jungle stretches below, dark and welcoming. You do not stop running until you reach the treeline.

Your uncle is waiting at the rendezvous point, his face tight with worry. When he sees you emerge from the undergrowth, the tension drains from his shoulders.

"You made it," he breathes.

"We sent a signal," you gasp. "Mayday. On the radio."

He stares at you for a long moment. Then he laughs—a short, disbelieving sound. "You did what?"

Hours later, you hear them. Helicopters. A dozen at least, their rotors chopping through the morning air. They descend on the island like metal locusts, black and gray and bristling with purpose.

Special forces. The real military kind. They storm the volcano. They dismantle TIME CORP's operation piece by piece. You watch from a distance as they lead the skeletal man—Doctor Claude, according to the patches on his coat—away in handcuffs.

But they do not stop there.

They capture the dinosaurs too. Every last one. Tranquilizers and cages and trucks rolling toward the shore. They evacuate Thea's tribe, confused families herded onto boats and shipped away from the only home they have ever known. They seize the research, the equipment, everything.

When you finally board the rescue helicopter, Thea is not with you. She chose to stay with her people, wherever they are being taken. You did not even get to say goodbye.

The flight home is quiet. Your uncle sleeps, exhausted. You stare out the window at the shrinking island until it disappears beneath the clouds.

A week later, you see it all on the news. Classified operation. Unprecedented discovery. Government custody. They do not mention you. They do not mention Thea. The dinosaurs are called "specimens." The tribe is called "displaced persons."

You turn off the television and sit in silence for a long time.

Then you check the clock. Eight PM. Tuesday night.

Dino Quest is on.

You grab the remote and change the channel. The familiar theme music fills the room, and for a moment—just a moment—everything feels almost normal again.

**THE END**
