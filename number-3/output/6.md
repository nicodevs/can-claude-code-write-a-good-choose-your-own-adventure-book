"She will come back," you tell your uncle. "Thea has medicine. Real medicine. We just have to wait."

Your uncle grimaces as he shifts his weight. The gash on his leg looks worse in the fading light—angry red edges, seeping through the makeshift bandage. But he nods slowly. "You trust her?"

"I do."

He manages a weak smile. "Then we wait."

You help him back to the crash site. The plane is a wreck—one wing sheared completely off, the cockpit crumpled like a tin can—but some supplies survived. You find water bottles, energy bars, a first aid kit with only the basics. Most importantly, you find the charging cable.

You connect your phone to the plane's backup battery.  The screen flickers to life, and you watch the charge crawl upward. Twelve percent. Fifteen. Twenty. Not much, but enough.

Night falls fast on the island. The jungle transforms into a chorus of strange sounds—hooting calls, rustling leaves, the distant crash of something large moving through the undergrowth. You build a small fire near the plane and keep your uncle close.

Hours pass. Your eyes grow heavy.

Then a shadow emerges from the darkness.

Thea steps into the firelight, her face streaked with sweat and dirt. In her hands, she carries a leather pouch filled with dried herbs, clay jars of paste, and strips of clean cloth.

"Medicine," she says through the translator, already kneeling beside your uncle. "Hold still."

She works quickly, cleaning the wound with water from a gourd, applying a thick green paste that smells like mint and something earthier. Your uncle hisses through clenched teeth but does not complain.

"Thank you," he whispers when she finishes.

Thea sits back on her heels, her expression troubled. She looks at you, then speaks slowly so the translator can catch every word.

"Something terrible is happening on this island."
