You cannot resist. This is the discovery of a lifetime. Forget Dino Quest—this is the real thing!

You crouch low and creep toward the riverbank, phone raised, camera recording. The small dinosaur continues drinking, unaware of your approach. You get within ten feet. The video is incredible—crystal clear, perfectly framed. You can already imagine the headlines, the interviews, the fame.

"Just a little closer," you whisper to yourself.

Then the ground trembles.

The small dinosaur's head snaps up. Its eyes go wide with primal terror. It bolts into the undergrowth so fast it seems to vanish.

You feel it before you see it. A vibration in your chest. A shadow falling over you.

You turn around.

A Tyrannosaurus rex stands at the tree line. Forty feet of muscle and teeth. The most famous dinosaur of all. The most terrifying predator in the history of the planet. The most—

It sees you.

Its massive head tilts. Those tiny arms twitch. And then its jaws open wide, revealing rows of knife-like teeth. The roar that follows shakes the leaves from the trees.

You run. You run faster than you have ever run in your life. But against sixty-five million years of evolutionary perfection, your legs are nothing. The ground shakes with each thundering footstep behind you.

It is a shame, really. That video would have changed everything. Too bad no one will ever see it.

**THE END**
