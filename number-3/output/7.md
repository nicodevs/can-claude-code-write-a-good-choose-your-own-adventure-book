BANG!

A gunshot cuts through the air. One of the utahraptors shrieks and tumbles backward, a red bloom spreading across its flank. The others hesitate, confused.

You look up.

Your uncle stands at the top of the cliff, shotgun braced against his shoulder. His face is bruised and bloodied, his left arm hangs limp at his side, but his eyes burn with fierce determination.

"Get away from my kid!" he roars, and fires again.

BANG!

The second shot sends the pack scattering into the undergrowth, hissing and snarling. They vanish into the jungle as quickly as they appeared.

You climb. Hand over hand, muscles screaming, you pull yourself up the rope until your uncle grabs your arm and hauls you over the edge. You collapse onto solid ground, gasping for air.

"You're alive," you manage.

"Takes more than a crash to kill me," he says, but his voice is strained. Up close, you can see how pale he is. A deep gash runs along his leg, poorly bandaged with strips of torn shirt.

Thea appears beside you, having found her own way across the gap. She takes one look at your uncle and speaks rapidly into the translator.

"He needs medicine. Real medicine. I will get it from my tribe." TODO

Before you can respond, she sprints toward the jungle. She shouts something you cannot understand—triumph? A promise?—and disappears into the green.

Your uncle sinks to the ground, wincing. "There's a raft," he says, pointing toward a nearby stream. "Found it near the crash. We could make it to the sea before nightfall. Get off this island."

You look at where Thea vanished. She said she would bring medicine. But how long will that take? And what else lurks in these jungles after dark?
