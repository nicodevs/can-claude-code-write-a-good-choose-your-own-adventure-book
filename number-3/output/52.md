"We need to find him now," you tell Thea through the translator. "Please."

She nods without hesitation. "Show me where."

You point toward the jungle, toward the column of smoke you saw when you landed. Together, you push into the dense undergrowth. Thea moves like a shadow, ducking beneath vines and stepping over roots with practiced ease. You stumble after her, trying to keep up.

The jungle is alive with sound—birds calling, insects humming, branches creaking in the wind. But beneath it all, you sense something else. Something watching.

Hours pass. The sun arcs across the sky and begins its descent. Sweat drips down your face. Your legs burn. Thea pauses occasionally to check tracks in the mud, broken branches, any sign of the crash.

Then she stops and points.

Through a gap in the trees, you see it—a thin ribbon of smoke rising against the orange sky. The crash site. It has to be.

But between you and that smoke lies a river.

The water is dark and fast-moving, churning over hidden rocks. It does not look deep—maybe chest-high at its worst—but the current is fierce. You can see debris rushing past: leaves, branches, the carcass of some unfortunate animal.

"We cross?" Thea asks, testing the water's edge with her foot.

You look upstream. The river bends around a rocky outcropping. Maybe there is a narrower spot, a fallen tree, something safer. But every minute you waste is another minute your uncle spends alone, possibly injured.

The smoke rises in the distance, taunting you. TODO
