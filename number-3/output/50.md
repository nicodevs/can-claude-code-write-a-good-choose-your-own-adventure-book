The Tesla coil screams with power. Lightning fills the air, so bright you have to shield your eyes.

Then something appears.

At first you think it is a building. A gray wall rising from the crackling energy. Then the wall moves, and you realize it has legs. Four of them, each as thick as a redwood trunk.

An Alamosaurus. A sauropod. One of the largest dinosaurs that ever walked the Earth.

Seventy tons of muscle and bone materialize on the metal bridge, and the structure was never built to hold such weight.

CRACK.

The sound is deafening. Steel screams. Rivets pop like gunshots. The entire bridge lurches sideways.

"Oh, no," you whisper.

You grab the nearest railing and hold on with everything you have. The T-Rex, still half-blind and disoriented, loses its footing. It tumbles sideways, claws scraping uselessly against metal, and plunges over the edge. The beast vanishes into the churning lava below with a final, terrible roar.

The Tesla coil follows, torn from its moorings by the collapsing structure. It spins end over end, sparking and dying, before the magma swallows it whole.

Doctor Claude screams.

Not in rage this time. In fear. His feet slip on the tilting bridge. His hands claw at nothing. For one frozen moment, his goggled eyes meet yours.

Then he falls.

The lava takes him without ceremony. One splash of orange, and he is gone.

You are about to follow. Your grip is failing. The railing bends under your weight. Your fingers burn.

Then a shadow passes overhead.

The Quetzalcoatlus. It swoops low, its massive wings beating against the thermals rising from the volcano. Acting on pure instinct, you let go of the railing and leap.

Your hands catch the creature's leg. It shrieks in surprise but does not shake you off. You climb desperately, finding purchase on its leathery hide, until you are straddling its back like a nightmarish horse.

"Thea!" you scream. "THEA!"

The Quetzalcoatlus banks toward the far end of the bridge, where Thea clings to a support beam. You reach down and grab her arm, hauling her up behind you. She wraps her arms around your waist, holding tight.

The bridge collapses completely. The Alamosaurus trumpets once, a sound like a foghorn, then tumbles into the caldera. But somehow, impossibly, you see it catch itself on a rock ledge. Its massive legs scrabble for purchase. Injured, but alive.

The Quetzalcoatlus carries you up, up, through the smoke and ash, until you burst from the volcano's mouth into clean, cold air. Stars wheel overhead. The jungle spreads below like a dark ocean.

You are alive.
