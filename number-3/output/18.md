You run.

Have you ever tried to outrun a dinosaur? There is always a first time. Unfortunately, there is rarely a second.

Your legs pump beneath you as you sprint into the darkness. Rain lashes your face. Mud sucks at your feet. Behind you, Thea shouts something and Grumsh roars a battle cry, but you do not stop. You do not look back. Every survival instinct you have screams the same thing: GO.

The jungle blurs around you. Branches whip your arms. Vines catch at your ankles. You hear the beast's footsteps behind you, each one a thunderclap that shakes the earth. The ground trembles with every stride it takes.

You glance back. Just for a second. Just long enough to see it gaining.

Its jaws are wide open. Rows of serrated teeth glisten in the rain. Those yellow eyes lock onto you like a predator that has already caught its prey.

You stumble. The mud is everywhere, thick and treacherous. You catch yourself, keep running, lungs burning, heart hammering so hard you think it might burst.

Then the jungle ends.

You skid to a halt at the edge of a cliff. Ten meters below, a dark lake churns with rain. No time to think. No time to plan. You gather every ounce of courage you have left and jump.

For one glorious moment, you are flying.

Then the teeth sink in.

The torvosaurus catches you midair, its massive jaws closing around your body before you ever reach the water. The last thing you see is rain falling into darkness.

**THE END**
