Days pass.

With Doctor Claude gone and the Time Blenders destroyed, TIME CORP crumbles. The surviving henchmen flee the island on whatever boats they can find. Some surrender to the tribal warriors. Others simply vanish into the jungle, never to be seen again.

The volcano grows quiet. The lava cools. The Alamosaurus, remarkably, survives its fall. You see it sometimes, limping through the valley on injured legs, browsing peacefully on the tallest trees. The Quetzalcoatlus circles overhead, a living shadow against the sun.

Thea's tribe holds a feast in your honor. They paint your face with red ochre and drape flowers around your neck. Grumsh sits beside the fire, telling exaggerated tales of the battle to anyone who will listen. Your uncle laughs for the first time since the plane went down.

On the morning you leave, Thea walks you to the helipad. The TIME CORP helicopter sits waiting, its rotors still and silent. Your uncle is already inside, running through the preflight checklist.

"You will come back," Thea says. It is not a question.

"Of course," you reply. "Someone has to make sure you are not getting into trouble."

She smiles—a real smile, bright and warm. Then she pulls you into a fierce hug.

"Thank you," she whispers. "For everything."

The helicopter lifts off. The island shrinks below you, green and mysterious, its secrets now your secrets. Thea waves from the shore until she is just a speck, then nothing at all.

You lean back in your seat and close your eyes. The sun is warm on your face. The engine hums steadily. Your uncle reaches over and squeezes your shoulder.

"Not bad for a beach trip," he says.

You laugh. You cannot help it.

Somewhere below, dinosaurs roam a lost island. Somewhere, a Viking sharpens his axe. Somewhere, a tribe of displaced people builds a new future.

And somewhere, you know, adventure is always waiting.

**THE END**
