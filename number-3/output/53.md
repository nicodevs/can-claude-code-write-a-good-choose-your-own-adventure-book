You close your eyes, expecting the worst.

BANG!

A gunshot tears through the rain. The torvosaurus staggers sideways, roaring in confusion and pain.

You open your eyes.

There, at the edge of the clearing, stands your uncle. Water drips from his torn jacket. A bruise darkens one side of his face. But in his hands, he holds a smoking shotgun.

"Get away from them!" he shouts, and fires again.

The second shot catches the dinosaur in the haunch. That is enough. The torvosaurus turns and flees into the jungle, its thundering footsteps fading into the storm.

For a moment, nobody moves. Then you are running, closing the distance between you in seconds, throwing your arms around your uncle in a desperate hug.

"You're alive," you gasp. "You're okay!"

"Barely," he says, hugging you back just as tightly. "The plane's a wreck, but I found a survival kit. Been tracking that monster for hours after it picked up my trail." He pulls back and looks at you, then at Thea and Grumsh. "Interesting friends you've made."

"It's a long story."

"I bet." He glances at Grumsh's horned helmet. "That one looks like he walked out of a museum."

You explain everything—Thea, the translation app, the Viking's trap, the power metal concert on the mountaintop. Your uncle listens with an expression caught between disbelief and amazement.

"I heard the music," he admits. "That's how I found you. Figured either my kid was throwing a party or the island had very strange birds."

Later, huddled around the rebuilt campfire, you wait for the rain to stop. Grumsh gnaws on a piece of dried meat. Thea stares into the flames, lost in thought. Your uncle keeps watch at the shelter's entrance, the shotgun across his lap.

When the others finally fall asleep, you and your uncle check the TIME CORP backpack more carefully.
