You catch Thea's eye and point toward the troodon's cage. She nods once, understanding.

Time to move.

You slip from behind the machine while Doctor Claude's back is turned. The lab workers bustle about their tasks, eyes fixed on screens and specimens, paying no attention to the shadows between workstations. You press yourself flat against a desk, then slide beneath it. A pair of boots passes inches from your face. You hold your breath until they are gone.

The troodon watches your approach. Its eyes—golden, slitted, terrifyingly intelligent—track every movement. The creature does not make a sound. It knows. It understands what you are about to do.

You reach the cage. The latch is simple, just a metal pin secured with a wire loop. Your fingers tremble as you work it loose. One twist. Another.

Click.

The cage door swings open.

For one heartbeat, nothing happens. The troodon sits perfectly still, coiled like a spring. Then it moves.

SCREECH!

The beast launches itself onto the nearest desk, scattering papers and equipment. A man in a gray uniform barely has time to turn before those razor jaws find his throat. He crumples without a sound.

Chaos erupts. Workers scramble for the exits. A woman tries to flee, but the troodon is faster—it catches her leg and brings her down in a tangle of screams and thrashing limbs.

"Stay back!" Doctor Claude shrieks, stumbling backward into his own equipment. "Stay back, beast from hell!"

The troodon turns its golden eyes on him. It tilts its head, almost curious, and then it pounces.

You do not watch what happens next.

You and Thea stay hidden, pressed against the cold floor beneath a desk, as the sounds of destruction echo through the lab. Glass shatters. Machines spark and die. Screams fade to silence.

When you finally emerge, the lab is in ruins. Equipment lies scattered and broken. The troodon is gone, vanished into the deeper tunnels of the volcano. And Doctor Claude... Doctor Claude will never hurt anyone again.

"Did we win?" Thea whispers.

You look at the shattered Time Blender controls, the darkened monitors, the empty cages.

"I think we did," you answer.

Outside, the sun rises over the island. Somewhere in the jungle, your uncle waits. And somewhere beyond the horizon, rescue will come. It has to.

But for now, you allow yourself a single moment of peace. The nightmare is over. TIME CORP is finished. And the dinosaurs—those that survived—are finally free.

**THE END**
