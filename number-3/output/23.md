"We need to go," you say. "Now." TODO

Your uncle does not argue. You help him to his feet and half-carry him toward the stream where the raft waits—a simple thing of logs and rope, barely big enough for two. You find a small pump beside it and inflate the rubber sections until the craft looks seaworthy. Or at least seaworthy enough.

Together, you push off into the current. The stream carries you swiftly through the jungle, past towering trees and hanging vines, past shadows that move in ways shadows should not move. You do not look back. You do not dare.

The stream empties into the ocean just as the sun touches the horizon. Orange light paints the waves. You paddle hard, putting distance between yourselves and that impossible island until it becomes nothing more than a dark smudge against the dying sky.

Days blur together. You ration what little water you have. Your uncle's wound grows worse, then slowly, miraculously, begins to heal. You drift beneath a canopy of stars, surrounded by endless black water, wondering if anyone will ever find you.

On the fifth day, a fishing boat appears.

The crew pulls you aboard, wraps you in blankets, gives you fresh water and warm soup. They radio the coast guard. By nightfall, you are in a hospital, surrounded by doctors and reporters asking questions you cannot answer.

How do you explain dinosaurs? How do you describe a girl who speaks a language dead for millennia?

You go home. You return to school. You watch new episodes of Dino Quest and feel a strange hollowness in your chest. Your uncle recovers fully, but he never speaks of the island. Neither do you.

Some nights, you dream of jungle shadows and ancient eyes. You wake with questions that will never have answers.

You survived. But part of you will always wonder what you left behind.

**THE END**
