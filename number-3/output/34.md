"Uncle," you say, your voice barely a whisper. "I saw something. In the jungle. By the river."

He looks at you, waiting.

"A dinosaur. A real, living dinosaur."

For a long moment, he says nothing. His jaw tightens. Then he lets out a slow breath and shakes his head.

"I thought I was losing my mind," he says quietly. "When the plane was going down, I saw something through the trees. Something huge. Something that should not exist." He meets your eyes. "If you saw one too, then we are not crazy. This island... there is something very wrong with it."

You both sit in silence, processing the impossible. The jungle around you pulses with strange sounds, and every shadow seems to hide something ancient.

"That raft," your uncle says finally, "is not safe. If there are creatures like that out there, we would be sitting ducks on the open water. We need another way."

Over the next few days, you work together. You scavenge parts from the wreckage, salvage wires and circuits. Your uncle, despite his injuries, guides you through repairing the plane's emergency radio. You take turns keeping watch at night, jumping at every rustle in the undergrowth.

On the fifth day, static crackles through the speaker. Then a voice. A fishing vessel, forty miles offshore.

"We hear you," the captain says. "Hold tight. Help is coming."

The boat arrives at dawn. You carry your uncle to the shore and climb aboard, exhausted, battered, but alive. As the island shrinks behind you, swallowed by morning mist, you make a silent pact.

You never tell anyone what you saw. Some secrets are too dangerous—or too unbelievable—to share.

**THE END**
