"At my signal, shoot it in the eye," you tell Thea. "I will slide under it."

Thea stares at you like you have lost your mind. "What? You are crazy!"

But it is too late. You have already started sprinting.

The T-Rex sees you coming. Its massive head swings toward you, jaws parting to reveal rows of teeth longer than your forearm. Hot breath washes over you, rancid and ancient. The beast takes a thundering step forward, the bridge shuddering beneath its weight.

You run faster.

Closer. Closer. The dinosaur's mouth opens wide, ready to snap you in half like a breadstick.

"NOW!" you scream.

You hear the whistle of Thea's arrow cutting through the superheated air. For one terrible heartbeat, you think she missed. Then the T-Rex jerks its head sideways, roaring in agony. The arrow protrudes from its left eye, buried deep.

The beast halts. Its remaining eye rolls wildly, blinded by pain.

It is all you need.

You drop into a slide, the metal bridge scorching hot against your back. The world becomes a blur of scales and shadow as you shoot between the T-Rex's massive legs. Claws the size of kitchen knives slam down inches from your head. Then you are through, rolling to your feet, sprinting toward Doctor Claude.

The old man's face twists with fury. "You fool!" he shrieks, jabbing his remote control. "You think you can stop me?"

The Tesla coil crackles again. Lightning arcs between the towers.

A shape materializes from the energy—wings first, then a long serpentine neck, then a beak that could swallow a horse. A Quetzalcoatlus. The largest flying creature that ever lived, hovering impossibly above the bridge on wings forty feet wide.

"Damn thing!" Claude snarls, slapping the remote. "Wrong one!"

Then you understand. Claude cannot choose what he summons. The Time Blender pulls randomly from whatever lived on this island millions of years ago. It is a lottery of nightmares.

"Stop!" you shout, still running toward him. "This is over!"

"Never!" His eyes blaze behind those black goggles. "I control time! I control EVERYTHING!"

He presses the button again.
