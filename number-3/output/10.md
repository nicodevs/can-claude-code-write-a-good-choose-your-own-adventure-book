"We should check it out," you say. "What if it's someone who can actually help us?"

Your uncle frowns but does not argue. Maybe he is too tired. Maybe the pain in his leg has worn down his judgment. Either way, you help him to his feet, and the three of you set off through the jungle.

You walk for hours. Thea leads, her bow ready, her eyes scanning the shadows. The translator picks up fragments of her muttered warnings—something about bad omens, about the air tasting wrong. You ignore them. You have to. There is no other choice now.

Dawn breaks as you reach the southern shore. The beach stretches empty and pale in the early light. No boats. No people. No help.

But there is something.

A massive metallic contraption rises from the sand like a skeletal tower. Copper coils spiral around a central column. Wires snake across the ground and disappear into the treeline. It looks like something out of an old science fiction movie. A Tesla coil, you think. But bigger. Stranger.

Your uncle pulls the compass from his pocket and checks the reading. "This is it. The exact coordinates."

BZZZZT!

The machine powers up without warning. The coils crackle with blue-white electricity. The air fills with the smell of ozone and something else—something ancient and wrong.

Then reality tears open.

A shape materializes in the blinding flash. Massive. Horned. Covered in scales the color of dried blood.

A Carnotaurus. Thirty feet of muscle and teeth and hunger.

It moves before you can blink. Your uncle falls first, knocked aside like a ragdoll. Thea fires her bow—the arrow bounces harmlessly off its hide—and then she is gone too, crushed beneath a clawed foot.

You try to run. You really do.

Your uncle was right. It was a trap.

**THE END**
