"Let's not risk it," you say. "There has to be a safer way."

Thea nods and gestures upstream. Together, you follow the riverbank, climbing over mossy boulders and pushing through thick ferns. The ground rises steadily, and soon you find yourself on a small hill overlooking the jungle canopy.

That is when you see it—a path. Worn and overgrown, but unmistakably made by human feet. It cuts through the undergrowth like a scar.

"Someone lives here," you whisper.

Thea's expression darkens. She says nothing.

You follow the path as it winds along the hillside. The river churns below, growing narrower but no less fierce. Then the trees part, and you stop in your tracks.

A rope bridge stretches across the gorge.

Old. Weathered. Half the planks are missing, and the ropes sag like they have given up hope. The whole thing creaks in the wind, swaying gently back and forth. Below, the river crashes against rocks nearly thirty feet down.

But from here, you can see it clearly—smoke rising from between the trees on the other side. The crash site. Your uncle.

"Uncle!" you shout. Your voice echoes off the canyon walls. "Can you hear me?"

Silence. Only the rush of water and the cry of distant birds.

Thea examines the bridge, testing one of the anchor posts. She does not look confident. Her eyes scan the hillside, searching for alternatives.

The path continues upward, disappearing around a bend. Maybe there is another way across. A fallen tree. A narrower gap. Something that will not send you plummeting into the rapids below. TODO

But the bridge is right here. And your uncle is waiting.
