You tap the flashlight icon on your phone. A brilliant white beam cuts through the darkness, shining directly up at your face from below. Your features twist into something ghastly—sharp shadows carving hollows beneath your eyes, your nose casting a monstrous silhouette, your chin lit like a skull.

The Viking freezes. His eyes go wide as dinner plates.

"BLACK MAGIC!" he roars, stumbling backward. His axe clatters to the ground as he makes a strange gesture with his hands—some kind of ward against evil. "SORCERY! WITCHCRAFT!"

"Wait!" you shout, fumbling with the phone. "It's just a light! It's not—"

But he is already running. Crashing through the underbrush, bellowing prayers to Odin, Thor, and every other god he can name. The translation app catches fragments of his terrified screaming before the battery icon flashes one final time and the screen goes black.

"Come back!" you yell into the darkness. "Please! We need help!"

Your voice echoes through the empty jungle. No answer comes.

Thea struggles against the ropes, but the netting is too tight, the knots too clever. You twist and pull until your wrists bleed, but the trap holds firm.

Hours pass. The night grows cold.

Days pass. The sun beats down mercilessly.

Your throat burns with thirst. Your stomach cramps with hunger. Thea stops moving on the second day. You hold on a little longer, watching the jungle blur around you, waiting for rescue that never comes.

At least you have plenty of time to think about your choices.

**THE END**
