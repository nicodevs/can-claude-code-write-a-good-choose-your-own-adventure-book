Desperate times call for desperate measures. You fumble with your phone, swiping past the translator and into your music library. Your fingers hover over the screen. What do you play for a Viking? Classical? Jazz? No. There is only one answer.

The opening riff of Nordic power metal explodes from your phone's tiny speaker—distorted guitars screaming like Valkyries descending from Valhalla. Double bass drums thunder through the jungle night. A vocalist roars something about swords and glory.

"EHHHHH!" he bellows during the chorus, shaking his head so violently that his long blond hair whips through the air like a golden tornado. He stomps one foot against the earth, then the other, a one-man mosh pit in the prehistoric darkness.

Thea stares at you from across the net, her expression caught somewhere between terror and bewilderment.
