You catch your uncle's eye. A silent understanding passes between you. These men have no idea that Grumsh and Thea are sleeping just a few feet away, hidden in the shadows of the shelter.

You give the slightest nod.

Your uncle moves first. His hand shoots toward the shotgun on his lap. One of the guards sees it and fires, but the shot goes wide, punching a hole through the shelter's roof. You lunge at the other man, driving your shoulder into his chest before he can pull his trigger.

The rifle clatters to the ground. You swing wildly, your fist connecting with the guard's jaw. He staggers back, dazed.

Your uncle has the other one pinned against a wooden beam, forearm pressed against the man's throat. The shotgun lies forgotten on the ground between them.

CRACK!

Grumsh's axe handle catches the struggling guard across the back of the skull. He crumples instantly.

The guard you tackled tries to rise. Thea's boot meets his temple. He goes still.

Silence, except for the rain and your ragged breathing.

"Nice timing," your uncle says, rubbing his bruised knuckles.

Grumsh grunts. "Noisy strangers. Bad at sneaking."

You drag the unconscious men inside and bind their wrists with strips torn from their own jackets. When they finally stir, groggy and confused, you are ready.

"Start talking," your uncle says, crouching in front of them. "Who are you? What is TIME CORP? And why did you bring us here?"
