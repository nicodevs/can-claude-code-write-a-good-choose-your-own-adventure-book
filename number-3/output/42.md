You pull the tarp tighter around you and Thea. "Let's wait," you whisper. "We might learn something useful."

Minutes pass. Workers in gray TIME CORP uniforms move equipment back and forth across the cavern. Crates stamped with warning labels. Coils of thick cable. Strange cylindrical devices that hum with an eerie blue light.

Two guards stop near the truck, lighting cigarettes. Their voices carry clearly.

"You hear about the new Blender?" one says.

"Almost ready, they say. Bigger than ever."

"They're not just pulling things through anymore. Boss wants to push them forward."

"Forward?"

"Into the future. Send a T-Rex to Times Square. A whole pack of raptors to the Pentagon. Imagine the chaos."

Your blood runs cold. They are not just capturing dinosaurs. They are weaponizing them. Planning to unleash prehistoric monsters on the modern world.

You lean closer, straining to hear more.

A hand clamps down on the tarp and rips it away.

Light floods your vision. Two guards stare down at you, their faces twisted into ugly grins.

"Stowaways," one says.

"Dinner," says the other.

You do not understand what he means. Not until they drag you and Thea across the cavern to a cage you had not noticed before. Inside, something paces. Something massive, with curved fangs the length of your forearm and eyes that gleam with primal hunger.

A saber-toothed tiger. And it has not been fed in a very long time.

The cage door opens. The guards shove you inside.

"Dinner," you whisper, finally understanding.

**THE END**
