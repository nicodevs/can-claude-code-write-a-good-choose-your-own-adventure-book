"Bad people live in the mountain," Thea continues, her voice low and urgent. "They make monsters. Creatures from the old stories. Beasts with teeth like knives."

Dinosaurs. You think of those utahraptors, their curved claws and hungry eyes. They attacked like a coordinated unit, like soldiers following orders.

"They attack my tribe," Thea says. "Kill our hunters. Burn our villages. We do not know why."

Your uncle exchanges a glance with you. "The plane," he mutters. "The engine just died. No warning. Like something shut it off."

Could these people—whoever they are—have caused the crash? Do they have technology that can disable aircraft?

"Where are they?" you ask Thea.

She points toward the center of the island, where the volcano rises against the starlit sky. A faint glow pulses at its summit—not lava, but something else. Something artificial.

"There," she says. "At the top."

KRRRZZZT!

Static bursts from your uncle's belt. The walkie-talkie—you forgot he even had one. The speaker crackles with interference, and then a voice cuts through. Human. Male. Speaking English.

"Do not approach the volcano. I repeat, do not approach the volcano."

You all freeze.

"If you hear this message, come to the southernmost point of the island. Fast. Over and out."

Silence returns. The fire pops and hisses. Your uncle stares at the radio like it might bite him.

"It sounds like a trap," he says quietly.

You look at Thea. She has drawn an arrow, though there is nothing to aim at.

The volcano glows in the distance. The southern shore lies in the opposite direction entirely. Someone is trying to help you. Or someone is trying to lure you into the open.
