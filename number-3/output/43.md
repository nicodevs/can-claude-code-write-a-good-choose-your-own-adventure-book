The path grows steeper as you climb. The jungle thickens around you, vines tangling overhead until only slivers of sky peek through. The smoke from the crash site fades from view as the terrain swallows you whole.

Hours pass. The sun sinks below the horizon, and shadows consume the forest. Thea moves cautiously now, her hand never far from her bow. You stumble through the darkness, relying on her guidance.

"We should stop," Thea says through the translator. "Night here is dangerous."

But you press on. Your uncle is out there. Every minute matters.

Then your foot catches on something. A vine? No—a rope.

SNAP.

The ground disappears. You lurch upward, tangled in coarse burlap netting. Thea cries out beside you. The trap yanks you both into the air and leaves you dangling from a massive tree branch, spinning slowly like a grotesque ornament.

"A trap," Thea hisses, struggling against the ropes. "Someone set this."

You hear footsteps. Heavy. Deliberate. Then a figure emerges from the darkness.

Nearly two meters tall. Broad shoulders like a boulder. Long blond hair cascading over a fur-lined cloak. A rough beard frames a weathered face, and perched atop his head sits a horned helmet.

A Viking. An actual Viking.

He peers up at the net, squinting. "Ah, they're not even lizards... they're humans!" His voice booms through the trees. "Hmm. I'm not sure I can eat them. They don't look very tender."

You understand him perfectly—the translation app still running on your phone. But the battery icon blinks red. Five percent. Maybe less.

The Viking scratches his beard thoughtfully.
