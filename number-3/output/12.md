You cannot wait. Your uncle is out there, possibly injured, possibly dying. Every minute counts.

"I have to go," you tell Thea.

She grabs your arm. "The storm will kill you!"

But you pull free. The elders shake their heads. They will not let Thea follow—she is too valuable to risk. You understand. This is your choice, your burden.

You step into the fury.

The rain hits like needles, stinging your face, blinding you within seconds. Wind shoves you sideways, and you stumble, catching yourself on a tree trunk. Lightning cracks overhead, turning the jungle white for a heartbeat before plunging it back into chaos.

You push forward anyway. One step. Another. The jungle becomes a maze of shadows and thrashing branches. You call for your uncle, but the storm swallows your voice.

An hour passes. Maybe two. You have no idea where you are anymore. The village is gone. The crash site could be anywhere.

Then you hear it—a low, rumbling growl that cuts through even the thunder.

You freeze.

Something moves in the foliage ahead. Something big.

It steps into view, rain streaming off its scaled hide. Your stomach drops. Anyone else would call it a velociraptor—Hollywood made sure of that. But you know better. Real velociraptors were chicken-sized. This thing stands taller than you, its sickle-clawed feet sinking into the mud, its eyes fixed on yours with terrible intelligence.

A deinonychus. A murderous carnivore.

At least you will die knowing exactly which species killed you. Science accurate. TODO

**THE END**
