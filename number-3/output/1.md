The small plane hums steadily as you gaze out the window at the endless blue ocean below. Your uncle sits in the pilot's seat, whistling an old tune. It has been a perfect day—swimming, building sandcastles, eating fresh mangoes on a quiet beach. Now the sun hangs low on the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink.

"We should make it back in time for your show," your uncle says, glancing at his watch.

Dino Quest. You grin. It is your favorite, and tonight is the season finale. You lean back in your seat and imagine what adventures await the characters. Will they finally escape the island? Will Professor Stone decode the mysterious fossils? You can't wait.

The engine sputters. The plane shudders violently. Warning lights flash across the dashboard like angry fireflies.

"What's happening?" you shout over the sudden roar of wind.

Your uncle's knuckles go white on the controls. Below, a volcanic island emerges from the sea—a dark mass of jungle and rock you have never seen on any map. Smoke curls lazily from the crater at its peak.

"Grab the parachute!" your uncle yells. "Now!"

"But what about you?"

"I'll try to land her. Go!"

The plane lurches. Smoke pours from the engine, black and choking. You hesitate for one heartbeat, two—then you strap on the parachute and throw open the door. The wind tears at your clothes as you leap into the void.
