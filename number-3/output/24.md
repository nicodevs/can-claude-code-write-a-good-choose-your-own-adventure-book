You walk along the shore toward the campfire. The sand crunches softly beneath your feet. As you get closer, you see the ashes are still warm—thin wisps of smoke curl up from the charred remains of driftwood.

Then you spot her.

A girl, maybe a few years older than you, crouches behind a large rock. She watches you with sharp, suspicious eyes. Her clothes are strange—rough burlap woven into a simple tunic and leggings. Red paint covers the skin around her eyes like a mask, making her gaze even more intense. A bow hangs across her back, and a quiver of arrows rests at her hip.

She steps out from behind the rock and raises one hand, palm facing you. A warning? A greeting?

Then she speaks.

The words are unlike anything you have ever heard. They sound ancient, almost musical, but completely incomprehensible. She gestures urgently toward the jungle, then back at you, repeating the same phrase over and over. Her voice grows more insistent each time.

"I don't understand," you say, shaking your head.

She frowns and tries again, slower this time, emphasizing each syllable. Still nothing.

Your phone sits heavy in your pocket. The battery icon was yellow when you last checked—maybe twenty percent left. Your translation app might be able to help, but what if you need that battery later? What if you finally get a signal and can call for help?

The girl grabs your arm and points toward the jungle again. Whatever she is trying to tell you, it seems important.
