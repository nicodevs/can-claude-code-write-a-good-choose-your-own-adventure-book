You bolt toward the helicopter.

Your uncle is there, leaning out of the cockpit, one arm stretched toward you. The rotors spin faster and faster, kicking up dust and debris. You can see the desperation in his eyes.

"Come on!" he screams over the noise. "Run!"

But the Time Blender has you.

The lightning coils around your body like chains made of pure energy. You feel yourself being pulled, not through space, but through something else entirely. Time itself bends around you, stretching like taffy.

"No!" you shout, fighting against the invisible current.

Your feet drag across the helipad. You reach out, fingers straining toward the helicopter, toward your uncle's outstretched hand. He is so close. Ten feet. Five.

Then the world tears apart.

Color bleeds away. Sound warps into a single endless tone. You feel your body dissolving, reforming, dissolving again. A thousand years pass in a heartbeat. Then ten thousand. Then more.

When reality snaps back into focus, you are standing on solid ground.

But the helicopter is gone. The volcano is gone. The island you knew has vanished completely.

Before you looms a ship the size of a skyscraper, hovering silently above a landscape of gleaming metal and crystal spires. The sky burns red with golden streaks, and countless lights crisscross the heavens like a constant rain of shooting stars. Ships. Thousands of them.

The air is thick and strange. Each breath feels like swallowing syrup.

A shadow falls over you.

You look up. A figure stands there, three meters tall, with an elongated face and eyes like pools of liquid darkness. No lids. No pupils. Just black.

It studies you the way a scientist studies a specimen. Then it smiles.

You do not know if that smile is friendly or hungry. A chill runs down your spine, deeper than any cold you have ever felt.

Welcome to the year one hundred thousand.

**THE END**
