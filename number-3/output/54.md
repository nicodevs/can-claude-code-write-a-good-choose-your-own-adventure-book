That night, you and your uncle sit before the village council—a circle of elders whose faces are painted with the same red markings as Thea's. Grumsh stands beside you, arms crossed, his axe resting against his leg. Thea translates, her voice steady and clear.

You tell them everything. The Time Blenders. Doctor Claude. TIME CORP's plan to control history itself.

The elders listen in silence. When you finish, the oldest among them rises. Her hair is white as snow, her eyes sharp as flint.

"We have always known something unnatural brought us here," she says. "Now we know its name."

The decision is unanimous. They will fight.

The next two days pass in a blur of preparation. Warriors sharpen spears and string bows. Scouts map the terrain around the volcano. Your uncle teaches a handful of volunteers how to use the captured rifles. Grumsh drills anyone willing to learn the basics of close combat.

You practice riding Whistle until your legs ache and your balance holds steady even at full gallop. The Dryosaurus seems to understand the gravity of what is coming. Its eyes are alert, its muscles tense.

On the second evening, two groups are formed.

"I will destroy those machines," Grumsh announces, studying the map's markers. "The Time Blenders. Give me warriors and we will tear them apart."

Thea steps forward, her bow slung across her back. "I will lead the attack on the base. We strike from the front while Grumsh strikes from behind."

Your uncle nods slowly. "It could work. Hit them on two fronts. Divide their forces."

You look between your companions—the Viking, the tribal warrior, your uncle. Four people from different times, bound together by impossible circumstances.

At last, the day of the assault arrives. The sun rises red over the volcano, painting the sky the color of blood. Warriors gather at the edge of the village, faces grim, weapons ready.

The choice is yours.
