The climb takes hours. Your legs burn. Sweat drips beneath the stolen uniform. But you push forward, using the map from the guards' backpack to navigate the rocky terrain.

Finally, you see it. A metal door set into the mountainside, nearly invisible against the black volcanic rock. The entrance marked on the map. The TIME CORP base.

"There," your uncle whispers.

You crouch behind a boulder and watch. Minutes pass. Then a truck rumbles up the narrow road, its engine straining against the incline. It stops at the entrance. Two soldiers jump out and begin unloading crates of supplies.

"Now," your uncle says.

You move quickly, keeping low, timing your approach to the soldiers' movements. When their backs are turned, you slip through the door and into the base.

The corridors are cold and sterile, lit by harsh fluorescent lights. You pass laboratories filled with strange equipment, control rooms humming with screens and keyboards. Soldiers march past, but they barely glance at you. Just two more guards among dozens.

Your uncle navigates using the map, leading you higher and higher through the complex. Elevators. Stairwells. Security checkpoints where you flash the stolen badges and pray.

Finally, you reach the top floor. A door marked HELIPAD ACCESS.

You push through and step into open air.

The helicopter sits on the landing pad, sleek and black. Beyond it, the island stretches to the horizon, jungle and beach and endless blue sea.

But that is not what stops your heart.

In the center of the helipad stands an immense Tesla coil. Wires thick as your arm snake across the concrete. The machine crackles with barely contained energy, lightning dancing between its copper rings.

A Time Blender. The biggest one you have seen.

"Damn intruders," a voice says behind you.

You spin around.

An old man stands in the doorway. His skin is paper-thin, stretched over a skeletal frame. White hair wisps around his skull like cobwebs. Black goggles cover his eyes, reflecting your own terrified face back at you.

Doctor Claude.

"Run!" you shout at your uncle. "Get to the helicopter! Start it!"

Your uncle hesitates for a heartbeat, then sprints toward the aircraft. You hear the door slam, the engine beginning to whine.

You pull Grumsh's axe from your belt and take a defensive stance, the weapon raised between you and the madman.

Doctor Claude does not seem concerned. He walks toward the Tesla coil, one hand resting on a control panel mounted to its base.

"This is the new prototype," he says, his voice thin and reedy. "Bringing creatures from the past to the present is useful, yes. Armies of dinosaurs. Warriors from lost civilizations. But the ideal dream..." He taps a button. The machine hums louder. "The ideal dream is to travel to the future. And I finally managed to do it."

Your grip tightens on the axe.

"I have not figured out how to make those I send return," Claude continues, almost conversationally. "But that does not matter. All it takes is pressing this button to send you to the year ten thousand. And you will never come back." He smiles, a death's-head grin. "What the heck, let us add a zero. Year one hundred thousand sounds better, does it not?"

His finger presses down.

The Tesla coil shrieks. Lightning erupts from its rings, blinding white, arcing toward you like living serpents. The bolts wrap around your body. Every nerve screams. The world dissolves into pure electric fire.

Through the roar, you hear your uncle shouting from the helicopter. The rotors are spinning now, the engine roaring to life.
