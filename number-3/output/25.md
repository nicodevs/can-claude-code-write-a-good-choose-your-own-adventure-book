You wait. What else can you do? The typhoon rages outside, rain hammering the huts like a thousand angry fists. Wind screams through the village. Trees crack and fall somewhere in the jungle. For three days and three nights, the storm holds the island hostage.

Thea stays by your side. She teaches you words in her language. You teach her words in yours. By the second day, you can say "friend" and "thank you" without the app. By the third, she can say your name without stumbling.

When the storm finally breaks, you rush to find your uncle.

The jungle is a maze of fallen trees and flooded paths. Thea guides you to where she saw the smoke on that first day. After hours of searching, you find the wreckage—the small plane, crumpled against a rocky outcrop, half-buried in mud and debris.

But your uncle is not there.

You search the surrounding area. You call his name until your voice goes hoarse. Nothing. No body, no trail, no sign he survived or perished. Just the empty, ruined shell of the plane.

You return the next day. And the next. Thea always comes with you, her bow ready, her eyes scanning for danger. Weeks pass. Months. The searches grow shorter, then stop altogether.

You never find him.

But you find something else. A home. A community that welcomes you as one of their own. You learn to hunt, to craft, to survive alongside creatures that should have been extinct for millions of years. The gentle dinosaurs no longer seem impossible—they become familiar, even comforting.

And Thea. Somewhere between the searches and the shared meals and the quiet nights by the fire, friendship becomes something more.

Years later, you stand at the edge of the village, watching the sunset paint the sky in shades of orange and pink—the same colors you saw from your uncle's plane, a lifetime ago. Thea takes your hand.

This is not the life you imagined. But it is a good life. A peaceful life. A life filled with wonder and love in a place that time forgot.

**THE END**
