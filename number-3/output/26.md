You slip out of the truck and land softly on the stone floor. Thea drops beside you, silent as a shadow. Together, you crouch behind a stack of metal crates and scan for guards.

The corridor to the Lab stretches ahead, lit by flickering fluorescent tubes. You move quickly, staying low, pressing yourselves against the wall whenever footsteps echo nearby. Thea's hand finds your shoulder, guiding you, warning you.

The Lab doors stand open. Inside, banks of computers hum and whir. Monitors display scrolling data, diagrams of creatures, maps of the island. Workers in gray uniforms bustle between stations, their faces hidden behind surgical masks.

And there, at the center of it all, stands the skeletal man in black goggles. He holds a phone to his ear, his thin lips moving rapidly.

You and Thea duck behind a large machine bristling with dials and gauges. From here, you can see everything. Hear everything.

"I need results, Claude," a voice crackles through the phone's speaker. The connection is clear enough that you catch every word. "The board is growing impatient."

The skeletal man—Claude, apparently—waves a bony hand dismissively. "The progress is incredible, Reinald. We can already bring creatures from the past. Dinosaurs of many species. And we have confirmed that humans survive the trip."

Your blood runs cold.

"We brought in several natives from the fifth century," Claude continues. "And even a Viking warrior from the twelfth century. The temporal displacement causes some disorientation, but they adapt quickly."

Thea's grip tightens on your arm. Her people. They were brought here. Ripped from their own time.

The voice on the phone grows more demanding. "Then why can't you bring Napoleon into the present? Or Genghis Khan? Julius Caesar? Imagine what we could do with history's greatest conquerors under our control!"
