You wake in a hospital bed. White walls. Fluorescent lights. The steady beep of a heart monitor.

For a moment, you think it was all a dream. The island. The dinosaurs. TIME CORP.

Then a man enters the room. Gray suit. Cold eyes. He pulls a chair close to your bed and sits down, crossing his legs like he has all the time in the world.

"You have been unconscious for three days," he says. His voice is soft, almost gentle. "You are back in your city. Your parents have been notified. They believe you survived a plane crash at sea. Nothing more."

You try to speak, but your throat feels like sandpaper.

"Your uncle," the man continues, "did not survive. A tragic accident. Very unfortunate."

Tears blur your vision. Your hands ball into fists beneath the thin hospital blanket.

The man leans closer. "Listen carefully. You saw nothing on that island. You remember nothing. If anyone asks—police, reporters, curious friends—you were adrift in the ocean for days. Dehydrated. Delirious. Understood?"

You stare at him.

"Your life is not in danger," he says, standing. "But it could be. You do not want to end up like your uncle, do you?"

He leaves without waiting for an answer.

The years pass. You never speak of the island. Not to your parents. Not to anyone. Sometimes, late at night, you dream of dinosaurs and titanium doors and a girl with red paint over her eyes. But when you wake, you tell yourself it was just a nightmare.

Just a nightmare.

**THE END**
