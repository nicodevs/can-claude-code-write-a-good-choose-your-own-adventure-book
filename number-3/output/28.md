You shake your head and pull your arm free from the girl's grip. Whatever she is trying to say, you do not have time for this. Your uncle is somewhere on this island, possibly hurt, and your phone battery is too precious to waste on a stranger speaking gibberish.

"Sorry," you mutter, turning away. "I have to go."

You continue walking along the shore, leaving the girl and her campfire behind. She shouts something after you—that same urgent, ancient language—but you ignore her.

The jungle presses close to the beach here, thick vines and broad leaves forming a green wall. Strange bird calls echo from deep within. Then you hear something else. A rustling in the undergrowth. Heavy footsteps.

A shadow falls over you.

You look up.

Your brain refuses to accept what your eyes are seeing. It is massive, standing on two powerful legs, its body covered in mottled scales. Sharp claws curve from its feet like sickles. A long snout opens to reveal rows of serrated teeth.

A dinosaur. A living, breathing dinosaur.

Your legs move before your brain catches up. You run, sprinting across the sand as fast as you can. Behind you, the beast screeches—a high, terrible sound—and gives chase.

It is fast. Too fast.

The girl's voice reaches you one last time, shouting words you will never understand. A warning, perhaps. An instruction. It does not matter now.

The deinonychus closes the distance in seconds.

**THE END**
