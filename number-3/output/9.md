You point toward the Radio Room and hold a finger to your lips. Thea nods.

Together, you slip off the truck bed and press yourselves against the nearest stack of crates. The workers are busy hauling equipment across the cavern, shouting orders, completely absorbed in their tasks. Nobody looks your way.

You move fast. Crate to crate. Shadow to shadow. The Radio Room door looms ahead, its metal surface cold and industrial. You grab the handle, twist, and pull.

Empty. Thank goodness.

The room is small—a desk, a chair, a bank of ancient-looking radio equipment with dials and switches that remind you of something from a museum. But when you flip the power switch, the console hums to life. Green lights flicker across the panel. A microphone sits waiting.

Your uncle taught you how to use the radio in his plane. The basics, at least. Find the right frequency. Speak clearly. Repeat your message.

You spin the dial until you find an open channel. Static crackles in the speakers.

"Mayday, mayday," you say, your voice barely above a whisper. "This is an emergency. We are stranded on an uncharted island. Coordinates unknown. There is a secret facility inside the volcano. They have dinosaurs. Repeat, living dinosaurs. Please send help. Mayday, mayday..."

You repeat the message. Once. Twice. Three times.

Then the door slams open.

Two guards stand in the doorway, weapons raised. Their eyes go wide when they see you—just a kid at the controls—but their training kicks in fast.

"Intruders in the Radio Room!" one of them shouts into his own radio.

Thea does not hesitate. She kicks the desk forward, slamming it into the first guard's knees. He crumples. The second lunges, but she is already past him, grabbing your arm and hauling you through a side door you hadn't even noticed.

Alarms blare. Red lights flash. Boots thunder behind you.
