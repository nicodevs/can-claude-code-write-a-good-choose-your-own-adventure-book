You shake your head. A dinosaur? He will think you hit your head during the jump. Besides, you have more pressing concerns.

"Let's just get that raft inflated," you say.

Together, you pull the yellow bundle free from the debris and find the emergency inflation cord. One sharp tug and the raft hisses to life, expanding into a bright yellow oval. Your uncle examines it with a practiced eye.

"Not bad," he says. "Help me to the shore. We can paddle out, try to flag down a passing ship or plane."

You want to argue—stay on the island, find help here—but his leg needs real medical attention. So you support his weight as you trudge back through the jungle, retracing your path until the beach emerges before you.

The ocean stretches endlessly toward the horizon. You help your uncle into the raft, push off from the sand, and begin paddling. The island shrinks behind you.

Then you hear it. A screech from above.

You look up and freeze. A massive winged creature circles overhead—leathery wings, long crested skull, a beak like a spear. A pterodactyl. An actual pterodactyl.

"What in the—" your uncle starts.

The creature dives.

You swing the paddle wildly, shouting, trying to scare it off. The pterodactyl shrieks and veers away, but not before its talons rake across the raft. Air hisses out in a violent rush.

The raft deflates beneath you. Cold water rushes in.

You and your uncle cling to the sinking rubber as the island disappears behind the waves. No ships. No planes. Nothing but endless blue in every direction.

Maybe you should have mentioned the dinosaur.

**THE END**
