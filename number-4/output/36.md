Light.

You squint as the cell door swings open, revealing a figure silhouetted against torchlight. For one wild moment you think it might be Corvus, returned to gloat. Or Malachar himself.

But no. It's a young woman in academy robes, her face streaked with soot and tears.

"We found you!" she says, rushing forward to help you up. "Thank the stars. We've been searching everywhere."

You try to speak. Your voice comes out as a croak. "Aldric—"

Her face falls.

"I'm sorry," she whispers. "Aldric is dead. Malachar completed his ritual. He's... he's more powerful than ever now." She steadies you as your legs threaten to give out. "Professor Corvus was revealed as a traitor. He fled with the dragon. We barely escaped the academy alive."

Dead.

The word echoes through your skull like a tolling bell.

Aldric is dead because you trusted the wrong person. Because you gathered every component Malachar needed. Because when you could have fought, you sat in darkness and did nothing.

You leave the dungeon a broken thing. The academy lies in ruins above—towers collapsed, gardens scorched, the great hall nothing but ash. Malachar terrorizes the realm now, nearly unstoppable, and it's your fault.

Every choice you made led to this disaster.

You drop out of what remains of the academy. You cannot face the other students, cannot meet their eyes, cannot bear their whispered accusations. You wander the countryside alone, haunted by memories of what could have been.

The guilt never fades. It follows you like a shadow, cold and permanent, for the rest of your days.

**THE END**
