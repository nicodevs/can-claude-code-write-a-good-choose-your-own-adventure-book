Weeks pass. Endless, agonizing weeks.

You attend classes, but the words blur together. You eat meals, but everything tastes like ash. You watch from your dormitory window as committees meet, plans are drafted, equipment is requisitioned. Forms are signed. More forms are signed. Debates rage about jurisdiction and liability and proper procedure.

Every night, you stare at Aldric's compass. The needle still points north. He's still alive. Still waiting.

Then one morning, the needle stops moving.

It spins aimlessly for a moment, then falls still. Dead. Like the magic that powered it has simply... vanished.

You know what it means before the announcement comes.

Headmaster Thornwick gathers the school in the Great Hall. His voice is heavy as he speaks the words you've been dreading.

"Archmage Aldric is dead. Malachar drained all his magic. There was... nothing left."

The words hit you like a physical blow. You grip the edge of your seat to keep from falling.

The dragon has grown stronger now. Reports flood in of villages terrorized, of farms burned to shadow and ash. Malachar is no longer hiding. He's hunting.

And Aldric died waiting for rescue that never came.

You pack your bags that night. You cannot stay here. Cannot look at Thornwick's face without seeing Aldric's blood on his hands. Cannot walk these halls knowing that somewhere, in a forbidden section of the library, there was a spell that might have saved him.

If only you had acted. If only you had broken the rules.

But you didn't. You followed protocol. And protocol killed your teacher.

You leave Thornwood Academy as the sun rises, a failed wizard with nothing but guilt and a compass that no longer points anywhere.

**THE END**
