You wake to cold mountain air and the distant clanking of golems still patrolling the factory floor.

Your hands ache beneath the makeshift bandages you wrapped around them before passing out. The burns are bad, but you'll survive. Your magical reserves have recovered somewhat—enough to continue, at least.

You check your supplies. The serpent hair writhes in its spelled pouch. The vampire fang gleams white in the dim light. The golem heart pulses with soft blue energy. Three components, gathered at terrible cost.

Now comes the hardest part.

You pull out Aldric's compass. The needle points north, unwavering, toward the Blackspine Mountains. Toward Malachar's lair.

You travel for two more days, climbing higher into the peaks where snow blankets the stone and the wind cuts like knives. The compass guides you through treacherous passes and across frozen rivers until finally, as the sun sets on the second day, you see it.

The Shadow Fortress.

A castle of black stone, carved directly into the mountainside. Towers rise like claws against the blood-red sky. Banners bearing Malachar's sigil—a dragon wreathed in shadow—snap in the wind. And at the entrance, torches flicker, illuminating a steady stream of figures in dark robes.

Cultists. Malachar's followers. They patrol the gates in pairs, their faces hidden beneath deep hoods.

You crouch behind a boulder, studying the fortress. The main entrance is heavily guarded. But you notice something else—a supply wagon approaching from the road, loaded with crates and bundles. Including what looks like spare robes.

Two options present themselves.

You could cast an invisibility spell and slip past the guards unseen. Risky—invisibility drains your magic quickly, and if the spell fails at the wrong moment, you'll be surrounded by enemies.

Or you could steal a cultist robe from that wagon and walk right through the front gate. Slower, but it would conserve your magic for the confrontation ahead.
