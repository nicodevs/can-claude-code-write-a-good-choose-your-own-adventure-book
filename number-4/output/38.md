You run.

Stone faces blur past you as you weave through the maze of frozen victims. A warrior here, a merchant there, their expressions locked in eternal horror. Your lungs burn. Your legs scream. But you don't slow down.

Behind you, the medusa shrieks. "YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME!"

Her footsteps pound the gravel. Closer. Faster. The serpents on her head hiss in a furious chorus, their sounds bouncing off the statues until it seems like the whole garden is alive with them.

You clutch the severed snake hair in your fist. One component. You actually got one.

But you won't live to use it if she catches you.

You cast a speed spell without breaking stride. "VELOCITAS!"

Magic surges through your legs, warm and electric. Your muscles burn as they're pushed beyond their limits. The spell drains your already depleted reserves, but suddenly you're flying across the ground, vaulting over a stone warrior's outstretched arm, ducking beneath an archway of frozen vines.

The gap in the crumbling east wall is ahead. Ten feet. Five.

Her claws rake the air behind your head. You feel the wind of the near miss.

You dive.

For one terrible instant, you're airborne, nothing beneath you but shadow and hope. Then you tumble through the gap and crash into soft grass on the other side. You roll twice, three times, and come to a stop face-down in a bed of wildflowers.

Behind you, the medusa's scream of rage echoes through the ruins. But she doesn't follow. Perhaps the boundary of her garden holds her. Perhaps she simply knows there will be other victims.

You lie there gasping, your magical reserves utterly spent. But in your hand, the serpent hair still writhes.

One component down. Two to go.
