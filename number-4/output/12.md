You pull back, letting the storm swallow you. Stealth over confrontation. Patience over recklessness. You're no match for Malachar in a direct fight, and you know it.

The dragon doesn't seem to notice—or doesn't care. He wings northward through the churning clouds, his massive silhouette growing smaller against the lightning-split sky.

You follow.

Hours pass. Your arms tremble from maintaining the flight spell. The magic drains you like a slow leak, sapping warmth from your fingers and strength from your limbs. But you refuse to stop. Every time exhaustion threatens to pull you down, you picture Aldric's face—his warm brown eyes, his patient smile when you finally mastered a difficult spell.

The landscape below transforms. Lush green forests give way to gray foothills, then to jagged mountain peaks capped with snow. The air grows thin and cold. Your breath fogs before you.

Finally, as dawn bleeds pink across the horizon, Malachar descends.

A fortress rises from the highest peak—black stone carved directly into the mountain itself, towers like claws reaching toward the sky. Dark windows stare down like empty eye sockets. Shadow seems to pool around the structure even as the sun rises, as if light itself fears to touch it.

The Shadow Fortress.

You commit every detail to memory. The winding mountain path. The collapsed bridge spanning a chasm. The single entrance—a gate shaped like a dragon's open maw.

Then you turn back toward the academy.
