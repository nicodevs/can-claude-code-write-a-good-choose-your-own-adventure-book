You lie on the grass for a long time, staring up at the sky. Blue. So wonderfully, beautifully blue. After hours in that darkness, even the clouds seem miraculous.

The moonstone rests in your pocket, cold and heavy. You pull out the crystal vial of phoenix tears and hold both components up to the light.

Two down. One to go.

Your magical reserves are dangerously low. The speed spell drained nearly everything you had left. You need rest—real rest—before you can continue.

You find a sheltered spot beneath an old oak tree and sleep for twelve hours straight. When you wake, the sun has already set and risen again. But you feel stronger. The magic has returned to your bones, humming quietly beneath your skin.

Time to move.

You travel back toward the academy, and Professor Corvus meets you halfway down the road, as if he knew exactly where to find you.

"Brilliant!" he exclaims, examining the moonstone with gleaming eyes. "Absolutely brilliant. I knew you could do it."

He hands it back with that same smile—warm on the surface, something else underneath.

"One more component remains. Starlight essence from the Crystal Spire. This is the most dangerous of all. The spire is guarded by enchanted crystal golems—constructs of pure magic, nearly indestructible." He pauses, studying your face. "But I believe in you. I've seen what you're capable of."

Three days of travel bring you to the Crystal Spire.

It rises from the earth like a shard of glass thrust into the sky—towering, impossibly tall, catching the light in a thousand fractured rainbows. Beautiful. Terrifying.

You circle the base, searching. The walls are smooth as mirrors, offering no handholds. But there—a narrow crack at ground level. Possibly an entrance.

Or you could simply fly. Levitation spells are exhausting, but they'd get you to the top faster.
