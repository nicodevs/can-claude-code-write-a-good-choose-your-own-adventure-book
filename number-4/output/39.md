You step back from the spire, plant your feet, and channel magic into your core. Levitation is advanced spellwork—exhausting, dangerous, exactly the kind of thing that gets third-years in trouble. But you've come too far to turn back now.

"Ascendio," you whisper.

Magic flows from your palms like water, and you lift off the ground. One foot. Five feet. Ten. The crystal wall slides past, smooth and cold, reflecting your determined face a hundred times over. Wind tugs at your robes. Your arms shake with the effort of sustaining the spell.

Halfway up, you pause to catch your breath. The ground is very far below. Don't look down. Don't look—

CRACK.

A section of the wall shifts. Crystal grinds against crystal. You watch in horror as a massive shape detaches from the spire itself—a golem, ten feet tall, made entirely of transparent crystal. Its eyes glow with inner light. Its fists are the size of boulders.

It swings.

You throw yourself sideways, barely dodging the blow. The force of it sends shockwaves through the air and nearly breaks your concentration. You spin wildly, fighting to regain control of the levitation spell.

"Impetus!" you shout, firing a force blast at the golem's chest.

The spell hits with a satisfying crack. A web of fractures spreads across the crystal surface. But the golem doesn't fall. It swings again, and this time you feel the wind as its fist passes inches from your face.

You push higher. Faster. Your magic burns through your reserves like fire through dry paper. The golem reaches for you, but you're already past it, scrambling upward through sheer desperation.

At the top, a crystal basin catches the first rays of morning sun. Inside, a pool of liquid light shimmers—starlight essence, pure and perfect. You grab a vial, fill it with trembling hands, and seal it tight.

Three components. You have them all.
