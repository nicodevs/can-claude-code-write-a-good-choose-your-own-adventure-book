You limp out of the infirmary the next morning, ribs still aching, and make your way to Headmaster Thornwick's office.

The old wizard sits behind a desk buried in scrolls and papers. His long silver beard spills over stacks of official-looking documents. When you enter, he peers at you over half-moon spectacles, his stern eyes softening slightly.

"Ah. The young hero who challenged Malachar. How are you feeling?"

"Headmaster, I need access to the forbidden section of the library."

He sets down his quill. "I see. And why would a third-year student require such access?"

You tell him everything. About Professor Nightshade. About the Codex Umbra. About the imprisonment spell that could bind the dragon and save Aldric. Your words tumble out in a desperate rush.

Thornwick listens without interrupting. When you finish, he steeples his fingers and sighs heavily.

"I understand your desperation," he says. "Truly, I do. Aldric is dear to all of us. But that section is forbidden for good reason. Black magic corrupts everyone who touches it. Even with the best intentions."

"But Aldric will die!"

"We will organize a proper rescue mission. Experienced wizards. Proper protocols." He raises a hand to silence your protest. "Give us time to prepare. This is too dangerous for students."

You argue. You plead. You nearly shout. But Thornwick is unmovable, his expression carved from stone.

"Go back to your studies. Let the adults handle this."
