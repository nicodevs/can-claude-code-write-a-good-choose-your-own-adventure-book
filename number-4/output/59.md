You let the cooling spell drop. The heat rushes back in a wave, pressing against your skin like a furnace door thrown open. But you push forward anyway, arms outstretched, palms open in a gesture of peace.

"Please," you call out, your voice cracking from the smoke. "I need your tears. My teacher—he's been taken by a shadow dragon. He'll die if I don't save him."

The phoenix turns.

For one heartbeat, you see yourself reflected in her eyes—tiny, fragile, burning with hope. Her beak parts as if to speak.

Then she screams.

The sound rips through you like a blade. And with it comes fire—not ordinary fire, but phoenix flame, white-hot and absolute. You throw up your hands and summon every ounce of magic you have left.

"Protego!"

Your shield spell flickers into existence, blue light straining against the inferno. For half a second, it holds.

Then it shatters.

The flames pour through the gap like water through a broken dam. You feel your skin blister, your robes ignite, your hair catch fire. You try to scream but the heat steals the air from your lungs.

Everything goes white.

Then black.

Phoenixes are creatures of pure fire. They don't negotiate. They don't listen. They simply burn, as they have burned for millennia. You should have stayed behind your cooling spell and taken what you needed quickly.

Somewhere in the Blackspine Mountains, Malachar drains the last of Aldric's magic. The Archmage dies in chains, wondering if anyone ever came for him.

No one did.

**THE END**
