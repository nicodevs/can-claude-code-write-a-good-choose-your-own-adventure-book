You raise the mirror shield before your face and begin your approach.

One step. Two. Your boots crunch softly on petrified leaves. The medusa's back is still turned, her serpent hair swaying gently as she strokes the cheek of a stone merchant.

You keep your eyes fixed on the mirror's surface, watching her reflection instead of the real thing. It's disorienting—like walking backward through a nightmare. Every instinct screams at you to look directly, to confirm what your peripheral vision suggests.

Don't. One glance and you join her garden.

The serpents sense you first. Their hissing intensifies. The medusa stiffens.

She turns.

Her deadly gaze meets the mirror—and you see confusion ripple across her reflected face. For one heartbeat, she freezes, staring at her own eyes staring back. That's your opening.

She reaches toward you with clawed hands, but you're already moving. You duck under her grasp, close the distance in a single lunge, and slash your sword in a tight arc.

SNICK.

A single serpent falls to the ground, still writhing. In the mirror, you see the medusa's face twist with rage.

"THIEF!"

Her scream echoes off the statues. Then lightning erupts from her palm—a crackling white bolt that slams into your shield. The mirror explodes. Glass shards spray everywhere, slicing your arms and face. You stagger backward, temporarily blinded.

The entire garden seems to wake. Stone statues tremble on their pedestals. The ground shakes.

You don't wait to see what happens next. You snatch the severed serpent hair from the ground and sprint toward the crumbling east wall. Behind you, her footsteps pound the earth. Her serpents hiss like a chorus of demons.

There—a gap in the wall. Narrow, but wide enough. You can make it.

Unless you turn and fight.
