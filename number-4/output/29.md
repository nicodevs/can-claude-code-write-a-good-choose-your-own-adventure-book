You rush to the apparatus controls, ignoring the urge to begin the ritual immediately. Aldric needs his strength back. He's the most powerful wizard you know—with his help, you could actually defeat Malachar.

The control panel is a nightmare of runes and levers, etched into black stone that pulses with dark energy. You trace the symbols with your fingers, searching for anything familiar. Some of them resemble enchantments from your third-year studies. Others look ancient, alien, wrong.

"Hold on, Professor," you whisper. "I'm going to fix this."

Aldric's eyes flutter open. They're dim, so much dimmer than you remember. "Child..." he rasps. "Don't... just run..."

You ignore him. Your fingers find a lever that seems connected to the flow of energy. If you reverse it—

You pull.

The apparatus shudders. The crystal above Aldric flickers, its pulsing rhythm stuttering. For one glorious moment, you think it's working.

Then everything goes wrong.

BOOM!

The apparatus explodes in a burst of black lightning. The force hurls you backward, slamming you against the far wall. Your vision whites out. When it returns, you see Aldric convulsing in his chains, the runes beneath him blazing with terrible light.

He screams. The chains tighten, draining him faster now—so much faster. Silver energy pours from his body in rivers instead of wisps.

"No!" You scramble to your feet, reaching for the component pouch at your belt. You can still do the ritual. You can still—

The chamber door crashes open.

Malachar enters.

He moves slowly, deliberately, his massive black form filling the doorway. Those burning coal eyes find you instantly, and his mouth curls into something like satisfaction.

"Foolish child," the dragon rumbles. "You've accelerated his death."

You fumble with the pouch. The serpent hair. The vampire fang. The golem heart. You can still—

A claw pins you to the ground.

The weight is crushing. You can't breathe. Your wand clatters away across the stone floor, far beyond reach.

"Too late," Malachar says.

His jaws open wide. Shadow and flame swirl in the depths of his throat.

Behind him, you hear Aldric draw one final, shuddering breath.

Then your world goes dark.

**THE END**
