Hours pass. Maybe longer. Time has no meaning in this cell.

You lie on the cold stone floor, listening to the drip of water somewhere in the darkness. The chains dissolved eventually—Corvus's spell wasn't designed to last forever, just long enough to get you here. But what good is freedom of movement when you're trapped behind iron bars?

You've failed. Aldric is going to die. The world is going to burn. And it's all your fault for trusting—

Wait.

You sit up slowly, squinting in the darkness. Your eyes have adjusted now, and you notice something you missed before. The cell door. The lock.

It's old. Ancient, even. Rust crawls along the iron like orange moss. The mechanism is probably centuries old, designed in an era before modern wards and enchantments.

You reach inside yourself, searching for magic. Your reserves are almost empty—the dispelling charm burned through nearly everything. But there's still a spark. A tiny flicker of power, barely enough to light a candle.

Enough for one spell. Maybe.

You press your palm against the lock and close your eyes.

"Alohomora," you whisper.

The magic flows out of you like the last breath from a dying man. Your vision dims. Your head pounds. But you hear it—the soft, beautiful click of tumblers falling into place.

The door swings open.

You stumble into the corridor, steadying yourself against the wall. Your legs feel like water. Your magic is completely gone now. But you're free.

You follow the pull of powerful magic—a distant thrumming that vibrates in your bones. Through winding passages, up spiraling stairs, past empty chambers filled with dust and forgotten things.

Until you find it.

The ritual chamber.

It's massive, carved from black obsidian that drinks the light. Malachar crouches in the center, his midnight scales gleaming, his coal-red eyes burning with anticipation. Corvus stands beside him, arranging the three components—your components—in a circle around Aldric's unconscious body.

Your teacher looks pale. Fragile. His blue robes are torn, his silver hair matted with blood.

But he's alive. For now.

Neither Corvus nor Malachar has noticed you yet. You're hidden in the shadows of the doorway, heart pounding, weaponless, magicless, desperate.

You have seconds to act.
