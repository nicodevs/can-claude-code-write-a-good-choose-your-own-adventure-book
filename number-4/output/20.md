You whisper the incantation, feeling magic flow through your eyes like cool water. "Tenebris visum."

The darkness peels away. Suddenly, the crypt becomes clear as day—every coffin, every cobweb, every crack in the ancient stone walls. Dozens of stone sarcophagi line the chamber, their lids carved with the faces of the dead. Dust motes hang motionless in the stale air.

You keep your wand dark. No sense announcing yourself now.

You move forward, footsteps silent on the cold floor. Your heart pounds in your ears. At the far end of the chamber, you see a raised platform with a massive stone throne carved from obsidian. Empty.

Strange. Where is the vampire?

You scan every corner of the chamber. The spaces between coffins. The shadows behind pillars. Nothing. No movement. No pale figure lurking in the darkness.

Perhaps he's still sleeping? Perhaps your timing was better than you thought?

You step closer to the throne, eyes darting left and right. A velvet cushion sits on the seat, worn from centuries of use. Beside it, a goblet crusted with something dark. But no vampire.

Then you feel it.

Cold breath on the back of your neck.

"Foolish choice, young wizard," a voice whispers directly behind you.

Your blood freezes. You try to spin around, try to raise your wand, but icy hands grip your shoulders with impossible strength. The vampire was invisible the entire time. Your see-in-darkness spell was worthless against his true power.

His fangs pierce your neck before you can scream.
