"Yes! Please, help me save him," you say. The words tumble out before you can stop them, desperate and raw.

Corvus smiles. Something flickers in his eyes—too quick to read, there and gone like a fish beneath dark water. "Excellent. I knew you had courage."

He pulls a rolled map from his robes and spreads it across a nearby stone bench. His finger traces a path eastward, past forests and rivers, toward a jagged range of peaks that seem to glow even on paper.

"The phoenix tears are closest—in the Ember Peaks, two days east. The phoenix nests in volcanic caverns at the summit. Dangerous, yes, but you're brave." He produces a crystal vial from his pocket and presses it into your hands. "Collect the tears when the phoenix weeps at dawn. That's the only time they fall."

"How will I know where to find her?"

"Listen for her cry. You'll know it when you hear it." He rolls up the map and hands it to you. "Go now. Every hour matters."

You tuck the vial carefully into your pack alongside the healing potions and protective amulets. The silver dagger hangs at your hip, cold and reassuring.

"Thank you, Professor."

"Save your thanks for after we've rescued Aldric." Corvus places a hand on your shoulder. "Now run."

You run.
