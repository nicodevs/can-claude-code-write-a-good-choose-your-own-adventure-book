You rest for an hour, letting your magic slowly trickle back. The serpent hair goes into a spelled pouch at your belt, still squirming but contained. When you finally stand, your legs feel like jelly, but you can walk.

According to your research, the Crypts of Ashenvale lie just a few hours to the north. An ancient cemetery where a vampire lord has dwelled for five centuries. The second component awaits there: a vampire's fang.

You travel quickly, following deer trails and overgrown roads. The sun traces a slow arc across the sky, and by the time you reach the cemetery, it hangs low on the horizon, painting everything in shades of blood and gold.

Crumbling tombstones jut from the earth like broken teeth. Dead trees claw at the sky with skeletal branches. And at the center of it all stands a mausoleum—massive, ancient, its stone door carved with warnings in a language you don't recognize.

The dying light casts long shadows across the graves. Soon it will be dark. Soon the vampire will wake.

You push open the heavy stone door. It groans in protest, the sound echoing into the depths below. Stone steps descend into absolute blackness.

You remember the warnings from your classes. This particular vampire can turn himself invisible. Impossible to fight what you cannot see.

You have two options. You can cast a spell to see invisible creatures and light your wand to navigate the darkness—but the light will announce your presence to everything down there. Or you can cast a see-in-darkness spell, moving without light, unseen but also unable to detect the vampire's invisibility.

You haven't mastered casting two "see" spells at the same time. You must choose one approach.
