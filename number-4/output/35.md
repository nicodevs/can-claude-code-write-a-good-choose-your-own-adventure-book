Midnight. The corridors of Thornwood Academy stretch before you, empty and silent. Your wand casts a soft glow that barely pushes back the darkness. Every footstep sounds impossibly loud against the stone floor.

Your ribs still ache. Your leg protests with each step. But you've already lost three days. Aldric doesn't have time for you to heal properly.

The forbidden section looms at the back of the library, separated from the ordinary shelves by iron gates twisted into arcane patterns. Magical wards shimmer across the metal like oil on water. You can feel them humming—ancient protections meant to keep students like you out.

You raise your wand and whisper the unlocking charm you learned in second year. "Alohomora."

For a terrible moment, nothing happens. Then the wards flicker. The iron gates swing open without a sound.

Inside, the air tastes different. Older. Heavier. Ancient tomes line the shelves, their covers black as pitch, their spines marked with symbols that seem to writhe when you look at them directly. Some of the books seem to breathe. Others whisper in languages you don't recognize.

You search for hours, pulling volumes from dusty shelves, scanning pages by wandlight. Your eyes grow heavy. Your fingers tremble with exhaustion.

Then you find it.

The Codex Umbra. Its cover is cold to the touch, like touching a corpse. When you open it, the pages seem to drink in the light from your wand. Black magic. Forbidden arts. Spells that twist the soul.

But there—on page three hundred and twelve—an imprisonment spell. Capable of binding even dragons.

Your heart pounds as you read the requirements. Three components. A hair from a medusa's head. The fang of a vampire. The heart of an iron golem.

Deadly creatures. Impossible quests. And at the bottom of the page, a warning written in red ink that seems to glow: "This spell requires a piece of the caster's soul. Once given, it cannot be reclaimed."

You memorize every word. Every gesture. Every syllable of the incantation. Then you slip the book back onto its shelf and creep out before dawn paints the sky.

In your dormitory, you sit on the edge of your bed, mind racing. You know what you have to do. But should you do it alone?

Luca. Your best friend. He's clever, resourceful, and always has your back. But this is dangerous. More dangerous than anything you've ever faced. If you bring him along, you might be putting his life at risk.
