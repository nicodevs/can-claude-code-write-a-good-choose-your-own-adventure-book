Within the hour, Headmaster Thornwick summons you to his office. His stern eyes hold disappointment heavier than any punishment.

The Codex Umbra sits on his desk. Confiscated.

"Confined to your dormitory," he says. "Until we organize a proper rescue team."

You argue. You plead. You beg. None of it matters. Rules are rules.

Two weeks pass. Two weeks of staring at walls while somewhere in the Blackspine Mountains, Malachar drains Aldric's magic drop by drop. Two weeks of hoping the "proper rescue team" arrives in time.

They don't.

The news comes on a gray morning. Archmage Aldric is dead. Malachar drained him completely.

You feel hollow. Empty. Like someone reached inside you and scooped out everything that mattered.

Luca avoids you in the corridors. He can't meet your eyes. Good. You can't meet his either.

Your friendship is destroyed. Your teacher is gone. And you'll spend the rest of your life wondering what might have happened if you'd just gone alone.

**THE END**
