You turn and sprint toward the academy armory.

Around you, chaos erupts. Students run in every direction, some crying, others frozen in shock. A tower collapses in the distance, showering the grounds with debris. Smoke rises from where Malachar's dark breath scorched the earth.

The armory door hangs half-open, blown inward by the shockwave. Inside, the walls are lined with enchanted weapons—swords that gleam with inner light, bows strung with spider silk, staves crackling with dormant power. You grab what you can carry.

A silver dagger, cold to the touch. Two protective amulets—one for warding, one for luck. Three healing potions that slosh red in their glass vials.

You strap on the gear with fumbling fingers, heart hammering. Every second feels like a minute. Every minute feels like an hour.

Armed now, you rush back outside and look to the sky. The storm clouds have thinned. The dragon is nowhere to be seen.

Gone.

You clutch Aldric's compass in your palm. The needle holds steady, pointing north toward the Blackspine Mountains. But how far has Malachar flown? How much time have you lost?

Too much, whispers a voice in your head. Maybe too much.

You push the thought away and start running toward the academy gates.
