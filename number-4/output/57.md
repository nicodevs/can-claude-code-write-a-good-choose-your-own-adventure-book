Mid-spell, an idea strikes you. The binding is working, but slowly. What if you could end this faster? What if you could offer Malachar something he wants?

You hold your focus on the incantation but raise your voice above the crackling magic. "STOP!"

The word cuts through the chamber like a blade. Malachar freezes, those burning coal eyes narrowing with surprise.

"I can offer you partial freedom," you shout. "A smaller prison. Some autonomy. If you release Aldric's magic now."

For a terrible moment, the dragon studies you. His massive head tilts, ancient intelligence calculating behind those ember eyes.

"Interesting," he rumbles. "You would bargain with me, little wizard? You have more cunning than I expected."

You modify the incantation on the fly, speaking words that were never meant to be spoken together. The dark energy swirling around you shifts, changes, becomes something new. Something unpredictable.

The binding snaps into place.

But not fully.

Malachar roars as chains of shadow wrap around him, pulling him toward the crystal above Aldric. But the chains are thin, fragile, shot through with gaps. He's bound, but not imprisoned. Contained, but not powerless.

The crystal stops draining Aldric's magic. Your teacher gasps, his eyes fluttering open. He's alive. Weak, but alive.

You rush to his side, helping him stand on trembling legs. "We need to go," you whisper.

You leave the Shadow Fortress together, Malachar's prison-crystal hovering behind you like a dark moon. The dragon cannot escape, but he can speak. And speak he does.

Every night, his whispers find you.

Years pass. Aldric recovers, though he's never quite as strong as before. You become the crystal's warden, forever bound to monitor the prison you created. Forever listening to the dragon's voice in the dark hours before dawn.

"You could have had more power," he murmurs. "You could have been magnificent."

Sometimes you wonder if he's right.

**THE END**
