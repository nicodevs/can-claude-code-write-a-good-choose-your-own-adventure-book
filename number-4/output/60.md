You stop struggling.

The chains of purple light dig into your arms, your chest, your throat. Every movement sends fresh waves of pain through your body. And what would be the point? Corvus is gone, carrying the three components you gathered—phoenix tears, moonstone, starlight essence—straight to Malachar.

You trusted him. You believed every word he said. And now Aldric will die because of your stupidity.

The cell they throw you in is deep underground, carved from black stone that swallows sound and light alike. No windows. No torch. Just absolute darkness pressing against your eyes like a physical weight.

You sit with your back against the cold wall and wait.

Hours pass. Maybe days. You lose track. Sleep comes in fitful bursts, filled with nightmares of dragon fire and Aldric's screaming face. You wake shivering, alone, defeated.

Sometimes you hear distant sounds—roars that shake dust from the ceiling. Explosions that make the walls tremble. Screams, faint and far away. Something terrible is happening up there.

Then silence.

The silence is worse.
