The corridor opens into a massive chamber.

Your invisibility spell finally fails, the magic slipping away like sand through your fingers. But it doesn't matter now. You've found him.

Aldric.

He's strapped to a dark apparatus in the center of the room—chains of black iron binding his wrists and ankles, glowing runes carved into the stone beneath him. His deep blue robes are torn and stained. His silver hair hangs limp across his face. His eyes are closed.

He looks so old. So fragile. So unlike the powerful wizard who stood against a dragon.

Above him, a massive crystal hovers in the air, pulsing with stolen light. With each pulse, something flows upward from Aldric's body—wisps of silver energy that spiral into the crystal like smoke drawn into a chimney.

His magic. They're draining his magic.

You want to cry out. Want to run to him. But you force yourself to think.

Malachar isn't here. Not yet. The chamber is empty except for your teacher and the terrible machine that's killing him.

You have the three components in your pouch. The serpent hair. The vampire fang. The golem heart. You could place them now, begin the ritual immediately while Malachar is away. Strike before the dragon returns.

But Aldric looks so weak. The draining apparatus is still active, still pulling the life from him drop by drop. If you could reverse it—feed his magic back instead of draining it away—he might have the strength to help you. To fight alongside you when Malachar comes.

Reversing the apparatus would take time. Time you might not have.
