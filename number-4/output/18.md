You find them in the library—Marcus, Elena, and Theo. Three students who trained under Aldric, who owe him everything. When you whisper your plan, their eyes light up with the same desperate hope you feel.

"We can do this," Marcus says, gripping your shoulder. "Together."

You leave at midnight, four shadows slipping through the academy wards. The journey to the Blackspine Mountains takes two days. You're exhausted when you arrive, but determination burns hotter than fatigue.

The Shadow Fortress looms above you, terrible and dark. You remember the entrance—the dragon-maw gate. Elena disables the ward with a spell she learned from a forbidden book. Theo casts silence charms on your footsteps. Marcus scouts ahead.

You're doing it. You're actually doing it.

The draining chamber lies deep within the fortress. You find it by following the cold pull of Aldric's compass. When you peer through the doorway, your heart clenches. There he is—your teacher, suspended in chains of shadow, his skin pale, his robes tattered. A dark crystal pulses beside him, drinking his magic drop by drop.

"Now," you whisper.

You rush in together. Marcus blasts the chains. Elena catches Aldric as he falls. Theo guards the door. You raise your wand to destroy the crystal—

WAAAAAAAAAAH!

Alarms shriek through the fortress. Red light floods the chamber.

"No!" Elena screams.

Cultists pour through every entrance. Dark wizards in black robes, their wands already blazing with killing curses. You fight back—all of you—throwing every spell you know.

It's not enough.

Marcus falls first, a green bolt catching him in the chest. Then Theo, overwhelmed by three cultists at once. Elena dies shielding Aldric's unconscious body.

A curse slams into your ribs. You collapse, gasping, your wand rolling away across the stone floor.

Heavy footsteps. The cultists part like shadows before a greater darkness.

Malachar enters. His coal-fire eyes sweep across the carnage, settling on you.

"Foolish children," he rumbles. "You should have sent adults."

His claw descends.

**THE END**
