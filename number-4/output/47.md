You circle around the fortress, keeping low, until you reach the supply wagon. It sits unattended except for a single cultist checking the cargo, his back turned to you.

You creep closer. Silent. Patient. When you're within arm's reach, you raise your wand and whisper, "Somnus."

The cultist slumps forward without a sound. You catch him before he hits the ground and drag him behind a boulder. His robe fits poorly—too long in the arms, too tight across the shoulders—but it will have to do. You pull the hood low over your face and step onto the road.

The front gates loom ahead. Two guards stand on either side, torches casting dancing shadows across their hidden faces. Your heart pounds so loudly you're certain they can hear it.

You nod as you pass. They nod back.

You're inside.

The fortress is a maze of dark corridors and flickering torchlight. Cultists bustle past you without a second glance. You keep your head down, following the pull of Aldric's compass until you reach a massive iron door.

Beyond it, you find him.

Aldric hangs suspended in chains, his body limp, his robes torn. Magical energy streams from his chest into a crystalline orb that pulses with stolen light. He looks older. Weaker. Dying.

You're about to rush forward when a voice behind you says, "You there. New recruit?"

You turn. A cultist stares at you, eyes narrowed beneath his hood. His gaze travels across your face, searching for recognition.

Finding none.

"Intruder!" he screams.

Alarms blare. Guards flood the chamber from every doorway. You raise your wand, but there are too many—a dozen, then two dozen, then more. Spells fly. Hands grab you. Your wand clatters to the floor.

They drag you before a throne of black stone where Malachar waits, his massive form coiled like a serpent about to strike. Those burning coal eyes regard you with amusement.

"Another snack," the dragon rumbles.

His jaws open wide.

**THE END**
