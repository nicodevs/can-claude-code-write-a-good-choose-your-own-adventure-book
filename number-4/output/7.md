You plant your feet on the cold stone floor and channel everything you have left into a single spell.

"SOLIS INVICTUS!"

Your wand erupts with brilliant golden light. Not the soft glow of lumos, but something far more powerful—pure, concentrated sunlight that fills the crypt like dawn itself has broken through the earth. The shadows flee. The cobwebs ignite. Every corner of the chamber blazes with radiance.

The vampire screams.

It's a sound you'll never forget. A shriek of pure agony as his flesh begins to smoke and blister. He throws his arms up to shield his face, but the light finds him anyway, burning through centuries of darkness in an instant.

"STOP!" he howls. "STOP IT!"

He lunges at you—faster than anything should move. You fire a force blast from your wand without thinking. "IMPACTUS!"

The spell slams into his chest, consuming more of your dwindling reserves, throwing him backward into his own throne. Stone cracks. The vampire tumbles to the floor, clawing at his smoking face, his expensive black clothes smoldering.

You advance, maintaining the sunlight spell even as your energy drains dangerously low. Your vision blurs. Your legs tremble. But you don't stop.

The vampire tries to rise. Falls. Tries again. His movements are sluggish now, weakened by the relentless light.

"Mercy," he rasps, collapsing to his knees. His voice is a whisper of what it was. "Please... mercy..."

You collapse the spell. The crypt plunges back into darkness, lit only by the dim glow still emanating from your wand. You're nearly depleted. Running on fumes. But you're not done yet.

You rush forward, pulling the silver dagger from your belt. The vampire flinches but is too weakened to stop you. With surgical precision, you grip one of his fangs and twist.

He howls. The fang comes free with a sickening crack, long and curved and gleaming white even stained with ancient blood.

You pocket the fang and stumble toward the stairs, leaving the vampire lord whimpering on the floor of his own crypt. Your legs barely carry you. By the time you reach the surface, the stars wheel overhead and you collapse onto cool grass beside a crumbling tombstone.

Two components down. One to go.

You rest for an hour, letting your magical reserves slowly refill. It's not enough—not nearly enough—but it will have to do.
