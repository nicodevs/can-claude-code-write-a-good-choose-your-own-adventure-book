You have no magic left. No weapons. But you have rage.

Corvus betrayed you. Used you. Everything you suffered—the phoenix, the shadow wraiths, the crystal golem—all of it was for him. For the dragon. To destroy everything you love.

You refuse to let it end this way.

You burst from the shadows, charging across the obsidian floor with nothing but your fists and your fury. "Stupefy!" you scream, throwing every ounce of willpower into the word, hoping—praying—that something remains.

A feeble spark of light flickers from your fingertips.

Corvus doesn't even turn around. He flicks his wrist casually, and the spark deflects harmlessly into the wall.

"Pathetic," he says.

But Malachar turns.

The dragon's burning eyes find you instantly, glowing like dying stars in the darkness of that terrible chamber. His lips curl back, revealing teeth as long as swords.

His claw sweeps across the room faster than thought.

You try to dodge. You try to—

The impact hits you square in the chest. Bones shatter. The world spins. You fly backward and slam into the obsidian wall with a sickening crack.

Pain. Everywhere, pain. Then numbness. Then nothing but the cold stone against your back and the distant sound of your own heartbeat slowing.

You hear Aldric scream your name. Raw. Broken.

But you can't move. Can't speak. Can't even blink.

The last thing you see is Malachar's jaws opening wide, flames and shadow swirling in the depths of his throat.

Then darkness takes you.

The ritual continues. Malachar ascends to immortality. And somewhere, in a chamber of black stone, Aldric weeps for the student who tried so hard and failed so completely.

Corvus's betrayal was perfect. And your reckless bravery sealed not just your fate, but his.

**THE END**
