You crouch at the edge of the lava pool, the heat pressing against your spell like a living thing trying to break through. Golden tears fall from the phoenix's eyes in slow, heavy drops. They hit the molten surface and begin to dissolve almost instantly, swirling into the liquid rock.

The vial fills with glowing golden liquid, beautiful and strange, like captured sunlight.
