Two days of hard travel through twisted forests and across rushing rivers. Two nights of restless sleep, haunted by visions of Aldric trapped in the dragon's claws. But you push forward, following Corvus's map, and at last the Ember Peaks rise before you.

The mountains are black as charcoal, their slopes streaked with veins of molten rock. Heat shimmers off the stone even in the pale light of early morning. Steam hisses from cracks in the earth. The air tastes like ash and sulfur.

Then you hear it.

A cry—haunting, beautiful, heartbreaking. It echoes across the volcanic landscape like nothing you've ever heard. Part song, part sob.

The phoenix.

You climb toward the sound, scrambling over jagged rocks that burn hot through your boots. Sweat drips into your eyes. Your lungs ache from the smoke. But you don't stop.

And then you see her.

She's magnificent. Feathers of gold and crimson ripple with living flame. Her wingspan must be twenty feet across. She perches at the edge of a cliff, head bowed over a pool of bubbling lava, and from her eyes fall tears of liquid gold.

They drip into the molten rock and vanish almost instantly, evaporating in puffs of golden steam.

You have to act fast. You pull out the crystal vial and cast a cooling spell around yourself—a shimmering blue shield that pushes back the worst of the heat. The magic drains your energy immediately, leaving you dizzy and short of breath.

You won't be able to hold it for long.
