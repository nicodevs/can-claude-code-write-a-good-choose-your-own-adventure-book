You spin around, squeezing your eyes shut, and raise your wand.

Total darkness. Your other senses sharpen—you hear her footsteps crunching on petrified leaves, her serpents hissing their fury. She's circling. Hunting.

"STUPEFY!" you shout, firing blind.

The spell drains your already depleted reserves. You hear it sizzle through the air and strike stone. A statue. You missed.

Her footsteps shift. Closer now. You pivot and launch a fire bolt, pouring more energy into the spell. Heat flares from your wand, but the only sound that follows is the crackle of flames against rock.

Nothing connects.

"Little wizard," she purrs somewhere to your left. "Do you think you can fight what you cannot see?"

You spin again, casting wildly. Another stunning spell. A force blast. Each one tears away more of your magical reserves, leaving you hollow and shaking. Your head pounds. Your legs tremble.

Then pain—white-hot and sudden—rakes across your arm. Her claws. You stumble backward, nearly falling over a frozen victim.

"Open your eyes," she taunts, her voice like honey and venom. "Look at me."

You know you shouldn't. You know that meeting her gaze means joining her collection forever. But you can't fight her blind. You're nearly out of magic. Out of options.

In desperation, you crack your eyelids open—just for a split second, just enough to aim.

That's all it takes.

Green eyes. Terrible and beautiful. They meet yours.

Cold spreads through your body instantly, starting in your chest and racing outward. You try to move, but your limbs won't obey. Your skin hardens. Your thoughts slow, then stop.

Another statue for her garden. Forever frozen, wand still raised in a spell you'll never cast.

**THE END**
