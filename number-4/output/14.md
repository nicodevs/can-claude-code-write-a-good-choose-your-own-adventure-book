You find Luca at dawn, waiting by the fountain in the east courtyard like you asked. The sky is turning pink. Birds are starting to sing. It feels wrong—too peaceful for what you're about to share.

"What's going on?" He rubs sleep from his eyes. "Your note said it was urgent."

You pull the Codex Umbra from beneath your robes. The black cover seems to absorb the morning light. Luca's eyes go wide.

"We can save Aldric together," you say. "I found a spell. An imprisonment spell that can bind even Malachar."

"Is that..." He takes a step back. "Is that from the forbidden section?"

"Yes, but—"

"Black magic?" His voice cracks. "Are you insane?"

"Luca, listen to me—"

"We need to tell someone. The Headmaster. An adult." He's backing away now, shaking his head. "This is wrong."

You grab his arm. "There's no time! Aldric is dying!"

But Luca pulls free. His eyes are wet. "I can't let you do this. I'm sorry."

He runs.
