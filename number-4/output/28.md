You can't wait any longer. Not another day. Not another hour.

That night, while the faculty sleeps, you slip out of Thornwood Academy with nothing but your wand, a few hastily gathered supplies, and the compass burning cold against your chest.

Three days north. You barely eat. Barely sleep. The Blackspine Mountains claw at the sky ahead of you, and when you finally reach the Shadow Fortress, you're trembling with exhaustion.

Guards patrol the walls. Cultists in dark robes. Far more than you expected.

You have no plan. No backup. No chance.

You try to sneak through a side passage, but a patrol spots you before you've gone twenty feet. Alarms blare through the fortress. They surround you in seconds.

You fight. Stars above, you fight with everything you have left. But you're one exhausted student against dozens of fresh enemies. A cultist's spell catches you square in the chest.

They drag you before Malachar.

"Another fool," the dragon rumbles, his coal-fire eyes regarding you with something like boredom. His massive jaws open wide.

At least you tried. At least you didn't wait.

Aldric dies alone in the fortress, days later. He never knew you came for him.

**THE END**
