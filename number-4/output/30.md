Malachar's claws rake the air inches from your face. You smell sulfur and ancient darkness. Feel the heat of his breath, the terrible weight of his fury pressing against your mind.

But you don't stop. You can't stop.

The final words of the incantation pour from your lips. Each syllable burns as it leaves your mouth, as if the spell itself is made of fire. The three components—serpent hair, vampire fang, golem heart—ignite with black flame, their energies spiraling upward in a column of shadow.

"NO!" Malachar roars.

Chains of pure darkness erupt from the ground. They wrap around the dragon's legs first, then his wings, then his neck. Black iron forged from shadow and ancient magic, links thick as tree trunks, cold as the void between stars.

Malachar thrashes. His tail smashes through a pillar. His claws tear gouges in the stone floor. But the chains only tighten, pulling him down, down, down toward the ritual circle where your spell blazes with impossible light.

"YOU CANNOT—"

A blinding flash cuts off his words.

You throw your arms up to shield your eyes. When you lower them, Malachar is gone. In his place hovers a crystal prison—an obsidian shard the size of your fist, perfectly smooth, utterly dark. Inside, you can just barely see the outline of a massive form, frozen, trapped, diminished.

Silence falls over the chamber.

You did it.

You rush to Aldric and tear at the chains binding him to the apparatus. The iron burns your fingers, but you don't care. When the last chain falls away, he slumps into your arms, lighter than you remember. His eyes flutter open.

"You used black magic," he says softly. Not an accusation. Just sadness.

"I know," you reply.

You help him stand. His legs tremble, but he can walk. Together, you stumble toward the corridor as the fortress begins to groan around you—ancient stones cracking, towers collapsing, Malachar's dark influence unraveling without its master.

As you escape into the cold mountain air, you feel it for the first time. A darkness inside you. A whisper of shadow curled around your heart, cold and patient. The piece of your soul you sacrificed will never return.

You saved your teacher. You defeated an ancient evil. You'll return to Thornwood Academy as a hero.

But you'll never be the same.

**THE END**
