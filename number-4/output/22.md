You set the lantern down and pull out your wand instead. Corvus told you to guard the flame with your life, but surely there's a better way. Surely you can reason with these creatures.

"Lumos," you whisper. Your wand blazes with white light, far brighter than the lantern's humble flame.

The whispers stop. For one hopeful moment, you think it's working.

Then they begin again—louder now, overlapping, furious. Dozens of voices speaking at once in languages you don't understand.

"I mean no harm!" you call out into the darkness. "I only need moonstone. I'm trying to save someone. Please!"

Shapes gather at the edge of your light. Formless, shifting things made of shadow and hunger. They don't have eyes, but you feel them watching. They don't have mouths, but you hear them speaking.

*Foolish child. Light-bringer. Soul-carrier.*

*We don't bargain.*

*We feed.*

They swarm you all at once—a wave of cold that crashes through your magical light like it's nothing. Your wand flickers. Your breath catches. Icy fingers wrap around your arms, your chest, your throat.

You try to cast a shield spell, but the words die in your mouth. You're too cold. Too weak. They're draining everything—your warmth, your magic, your life itself.

The lantern on the ground gutters and dies.

Your last thought is of Aldric, chained in Malachar's fortress, waiting for a rescue that will never come. You failed him. You failed everyone.

The shadow wraiths don't understand mercy. They only understand hunger.

And they are very, very hungry.

**THE END**
