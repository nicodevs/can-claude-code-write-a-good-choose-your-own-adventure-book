You raise your wand and whisper the incantation.

"Somnus profundis."

Purple mist flows from your wand tip, curling through the air like a living thing. It drifts toward the medusa, silent and slow, weaving between the petrified statues.

The serpents on her head stop moving. They taste the air. The medusa turns her face slightly, nostrils flaring.

"What is this?" she murmurs. "Something... sweet..."

The mist envelops her. You watch from behind the knight statue, heart hammering, as the purple tendrils wrap around her like a soft blanket. Her serpent hair droops. Her eyes flutter.

"What... what have you..."

She sways. Her knees buckle. And then she collapses among her stone victims, the serpents on her head going limp one by one. Within moments, the only sound is her slow, rhythmic breathing.

Snoring. The medusa is actually snoring.

You wait. Ten heartbeats. Twenty. She doesn't stir.

Success.

You creep forward, keeping your eyes fixed firmly on the ground. Her pale hand lies inches from your boot. You can see the serpents now, coiled and dormant atop her skull. Just one hair. That's all you need.

Carefully, ever so carefully, you reach down and pluck a single serpent strand from her head.

She doesn't move.

You tuck the hair into your pouch and allow yourself a small smile. First component acquired.
