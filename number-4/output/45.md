You ignore the ground rushing toward you. What does it matter? If you're going to die anyway, you might as well make it count.

You pour everything you have left into your wand. Every scrap of magic. Every last drop of energy. The wood grows hot in your grip, then scalding, then white-hot. You don't care. You point it at the dragon above and scream words you didn't even know you knew.

Fire erupts from your wand in a column of heat and fury—not orange, not red, but blinding white. The most powerful spell you've ever cast. The most powerful spell you'll ever cast.

It strikes Malachar directly in the chest.

The dragon ROARS. The sound shakes the sky itself. For one glorious moment, you see him stagger in the air, scales smoking, wings faltering.

You smile.

Then the ground arrives.

No shield. No protection. No energy left. Just you and the cobblestones of the academy courtyard, meeting at terrible speed.

The students who rush to your broken body find you still smiling.

Malachar flies away with Aldric—injured, bleeding shadow-fire from his chest, but alive. Your desperate attack wounded him but saved no one.

The academy holds a funeral three days later. They call you brave. They call you a hero. Small comfort to your grieving family as they watch your empty chair at the dinner table.

Aldric dies that same day, in Malachar's lair, his magic drained completely.

Your sacrifice achieved nothing but a good story for the history books.

**THE END**
