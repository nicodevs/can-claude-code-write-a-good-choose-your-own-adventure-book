You approach the narrow crack at the base of the spire. Up close, it's larger than it appeared—a proper doorway, concealed in the crystal's refractions. Ancient runes shimmer across its surface, pulsing with faint blue light.

A locked door. Magical wards.

You've seen this kind of thing before. Professor Aldric taught you the theory in your second year—runic locks respond to intent as much as incantation. You press your palm against the cold crystal and channel your will into the spell.

"Aperio."

The magic drains from you like water through a sieve. Your knees buckle. But the runes flare bright, then fade, and the door swings inward with a soft chime.

Inside, darkness. A spiral staircase winds upward into shadow, the steps carved from the same flawless crystal as the walls. You light your wand and begin to climb.

One floor. Two. Three.

Then you hear it—a grinding sound, like stone dragging against stone.

Crystal golems emerge from alcoves you hadn't noticed. Their bodies are translucent, refracting the light from your wand into blinding rainbows. Their eyes glow with cold intelligence.

"Protego!" you shout.

A barrier springs up behind you, slowing the first wave. You keep climbing, lungs burning, legs screaming. The stairs seem endless. The golems' footsteps echo below—relentless, patient.

At last, you reach the top. A chamber of pure light. And there, floating in the center, a sphere of captured starlight.

You grab it.

The golems pour through the doorway. Five. Ten. More.

You fire spell after spell—stunning hexes, force blasts, anything you can muster. But your magic is nearly gone, and they keep coming.

A crystal fist connects with your skull.

Everything goes white.

Then black.

Then nothing at all.

**THE END**
