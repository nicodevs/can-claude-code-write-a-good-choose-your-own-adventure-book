Malachar's claw pierces your chest.

Pain explodes through you—white-hot, blinding, absolute. You feel the dragon's talon tear through flesh and bone, feel the cold grip of death closing around your heart. Your legs give out. You crumple to the obsidian floor.

But even as darkness creeps into the edges of your vision, you see Aldric stumbling toward the exit. Running. Alive.

And behind you, the ritual energy reaches critical mass.

The explosion is silent at first—a pulse of pure white light that expands outward in all directions. Then the sound hits, a thunderclap that shakes the mountain itself. Fire and shadow and starlight collide in a maelstrom of destruction.

Malachar screams. Corvus screams. You feel the heat wash over you, feel the ancient dragon's grip go slack as the energy consumes him, tearing his midnight scales apart atom by atom.

Then everything goes white.

---

When the dust settles, Aldric finds your body amid the rubble.

You look peaceful, he'll tell them later. Like you were sleeping.

But you're gone.

And so is Malachar the Dread—destroyed utterly, his ashes scattered across the ruined chamber. The shadow dragon who terrorized the world for centuries, finally defeated. Not by an army of archmages. Not by ancient seals or binding rituals.

By a third-year student with no magic left and everything to lose.

Aldric carries you home himself. He won't let anyone else do it.

At Thornwood Academy, they build a statue in your honor—a young wizard with determined eyes, wand raised against the darkness. Your name is carved into the stone beneath it:

*Hero of Thornwood. Dragon Slayer. Friend.*

Every year on the anniversary of that day, students gather at the statue and light their wands in tribute. The light fills the courtyard like a sea of stars.

You saved everyone.

And they will never forget.

**THE END**
