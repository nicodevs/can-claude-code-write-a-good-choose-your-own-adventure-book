You spend days in the library, then weeks.

Ancient tomes. Forbidden grimoires. Scrolls so old they crumble at your touch. You search for any spell powerful enough to face a shadow dragon, any ritual that might save Aldric without requiring trust in a stranger whose smile never reached his eyes.

Nothing works. Nothing is strong enough.

The compass needle never wavers. North. Always north. But you don't follow it. Not yet. Not until you have a plan.

Then, on the twenty-third day, the news arrives.

Archmage Aldric is dead.

Malachar drained his magic completely—every last spark of power that made him one of the greatest wizards of his generation. The dragon used that stolen magic to break three more seals, freeing shadow creatures that now terrorize the northern villages.

And there's more.

Professor Corvus was arrested two days ago. Evidence found in his chambers revealed the truth: he was a spy for Malachar all along. The components he wanted you to gather weren't for a binding ritual. They were for a dark ascension ceremony that would have made the dragon immortal.

Your instincts were right. Corvus was a traitor.

But being right doesn't bring Aldric back.

You stare at the compass in your hands. The needle still points north, but now it spins slowly, aimlessly, as if searching for something that no longer exists.

You were so careful. So cautious. And your caution killed the man who believed in you most.

Sometimes the safe choice isn't the right choice.

**THE END**
