You raise your wand and scream the words.

"FULMINUS MAXIMA!"

Lightning erupts from your wand in brilliant arcs—white-hot bolts that tear through the storm like angry serpents. They strike Malachar's wings with a thunderous CRACK, sending sparks cascading into the night.

The dragon shrieks. It's a sound of rage more than pain, but you feel a surge of triumph. You actually hit him!

Then the triumph dies.

Malachar wheels around, his massive body cutting through the clouds like a ship through water. Those burning coal eyes fix on you with murderous intent.

"FOOLISH CHILD!"

His voice explodes in your mind, bypassing your ears entirely. The force of it nearly knocks you from the sky. Your magical reserves are draining fast—flight spells are exhausting enough without combat magic layered on top.

The dragon releases Aldric momentarily, letting your teacher dangle from a single claw while he swats at you with the other. A wall of black scales rushes toward your face.

"IMPACTUS!" you scream, firing a force blast.

The spell connects—more energy consumed—but it barely slows him. Like throwing a pebble at a charging bull. You twist sideways, dodging one massive claw, but the second strike connects with your shoulder.

Pain explodes through your body. You're spinning, tumbling, the world becoming a blur of storm and shadow. Your wand nearly slips from your fingers.

You try to recover. Try to right yourself. But your magical reserves are nearly empty—just fumes left in the tank. And you're falling. Plummeting toward the academy grounds far below.

The earth rushes up at you. Towers and courtyards growing larger by the second. You have moments to decide.
