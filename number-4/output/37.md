You return to Thornwood Academy triumphant, exhausted, and filled with hope. Professor Corvus waits in his office, the other two components arranged carefully on his desk—the phoenix tears glowing gold, the moonstone pulsing with captured shadow.

"You did it," he breathes as you place the vial of starlight essence beside them. "All three. Magnificent."

He gathers the components with reverent hands, cradling them like precious children.

"Now we can perform the ritual and save Aldric!" His voice rises with excitement. "Everything is finally—"

He stops.

His expression changes. The warmth drains from his face like water from a cracked cup. What remains is cold. Calculating. A smile you've never seen before—sharp and cruel.

"Actually," Corvus says softly, "these aren't for saving anyone."

Your blood turns to ice.

"They're for Malachar's ascension ritual. The dragon needs these exact components to break the remaining seals and free his brethren." He tucks the vials into his robes. "I've been serving him for years. And you... you've been so very helpful."

"No." The word comes out as a whisper.

"Yes." He raises his hand, and dark energy crackles between his fingers. "Vincula!"

Chains of purple light erupt from nowhere, wrapping around your arms, your legs, your chest. You struggle, but the magic holds tight, squeezing the breath from your lungs. You collapse to the floor, bound and helpless.

Corvus stands over you, his green eyes glinting with triumph.

"Don't worry. You'll live long enough to watch the world burn."
