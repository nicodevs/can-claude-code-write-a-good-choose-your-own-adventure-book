Something about Corvus feels wrong.

You can't quite name it. The eagerness in his voice. That strange gleam in his eyes. The way he appeared so quickly, so conveniently, with a plan already formed. Three components, three locations—all memorized, ready to recite.

How does he know so much about imprisoning a dragon that's been sealed away for centuries?

"Thank you, Professor," you say slowly, taking a step back. "But I'll find my own way to save Aldric."

Corvus's expression flickers. Just for a moment—a shadow passing behind his eyes, something cold and sharp. Then the mask returns, smooth as glass.

"Are you certain?" His voice carries an edge now. "Time is running out. Every second you waste—"

"I'm certain."

You hold his gaze. Your hand drifts to the silver dagger at your belt.

Corvus watches you for a long moment. Then he sighs, shoulders slumping. "Very well. I only wanted to help. But if you change your mind..."

You don't wait for him to finish. You turn and walk away, through the smoke and the screaming, toward the academy library. There must be another way. A safer way. Something that doesn't require trusting a man whose helpfulness feels like a trap.

Behind you, you can almost feel Corvus's eyes burning into your back.
