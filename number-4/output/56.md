You turn to leave.

"THIEF!"

The scream tears through the garden like a blade. You spin around—a mistake, a terrible mistake—and find yourself staring directly into eyes of deadly green.

The medusa stands where she fell, fully awake, fully furious. The serpents on her head writhe and hiss, their fangs bared. The sleeping spell wasn't strong enough. It only dazed her for a moment.

"You thought you could steal from ME?"

She lunges, impossibly fast. You try to look away, try to raise your wand, try to do anything at all. But her gaze has already locked with yours, and cold spreads through your body like ice water in your veins.

No. Not like this.

Your fingers stiffen around your wand. Your legs refuse to move. The cold climbs up your chest, your neck, your face. You can feel yourself hardening, feel the warmth draining from your skin.

The last thing you see is her smile—cruel and satisfied.

The last thing you think is of Aldric, still waiting to be saved.

Then the cold reaches your mind, and everything stops.

Another statue joins the Petrified Gardens. Another victim who underestimated a medusa's wrath. The serpent hair falls from your frozen fingers and tumbles to the ground.

The sleeping spell failed.

**THE END**
