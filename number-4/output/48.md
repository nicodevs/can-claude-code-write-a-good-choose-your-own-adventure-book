You have no magic left. No weapons. No time to think.

But you have your aim.

Your eyes lock onto the moonstone—that pale blue crystal you nearly died to retrieve from the Whispering Caves. It sits in the ritual circle, pulsing with captured shadow-light. If you can shatter it...

You grab a loose chunk of obsidian from the floor, feel its weight in your palm. One shot. You'll only get one shot.

You wind up and throw.

The stone flies true.

CRACK!

The moonstone explodes in a burst of blue-white light. The ritual circle erupts with blinding energy, ribbons of power spiraling wildly in every direction. The chamber shakes. Dust rains from the ceiling.

Malachar rears back, his terrible roar shaking the walls. "NO!"

Corvus spins, his face twisted with fury. "You fool!" he screams, spotting you in the doorway. "You've destabilized everything!"

The other components react violently. The phoenix tears ignite, golden fire leaping from the crystal vial. The starlight essence burns with cold white light, crackling and hissing. Energy spirals out of control, feeding on itself, growing stronger with every passing second.

Through the chaos, you see Aldric stirring. His eyes flutter open—confused, weak, but alive.

You sprint across the chamber, dodging tendrils of wild magic that scorch the air around you. You slide to your knees beside your teacher and grab his arm.

"The ritual—it's collapsing!" you shout over the roar. "We have to go! Now!"

But Malachar is faster than you imagined.

The shadow dragon lunges, claws extended, coal-red eyes burning with hatred. You shove Aldric aside with all your strength.

"Run!" you scream.
