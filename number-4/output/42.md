You gather every last drop of magic left in your exhausted body. It's not much—barely a flicker compared to the inferno you'd need. But you have to try.

"Dispello!" you scream.

Energy surges through you, white-hot and desperate. The purple chains around your chest flicker. For one glorious moment, you feel them loosening, feel hope rising in your throat—

Then they snap tight again.

Corvus laughs, a cold sound that echoes off the stone walls. "Admirable, but futile. Did you really think a third-year student could break enchantments crafted by a master of dark magic?"

He gestures lazily, almost bored.

The chains respond instantly. They constrict like living serpents, crushing the air from your lungs. You gasp, vision swimming, stars exploding behind your eyes. You can't breathe. Can't think. Can't—

"Malachar will drain Aldric's power tonight," Corvus says, crouching beside you. His voice is soft, almost gentle. "Then he'll use these components to complete his ascension. Immortality. Unlimited power. And you..." He smiles. "You'll watch from the dungeon. Front row seat to the end of the world."

He grabs your bound arms and drags you through corridors you've never seen—hidden passages beneath the academy, carved from black stone, lit by flickering green torchlight. You struggle, but the chains sap your strength with every passing second.

A heavy iron door swings open. Corvus throws you inside.

You hit cold stone. The door slams shut with a boom that shakes your bones.

Darkness swallows you whole.
