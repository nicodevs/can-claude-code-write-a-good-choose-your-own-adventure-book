The journey back to Thornwood Academy takes another two days. Your legs ache, your boots are worn thin, and you've barely slept. But the crystal vial glows warm against your chest, a constant reminder that you succeeded.

Professor Corvus is waiting at the academy gates when you arrive. His eyes light up the moment he sees you—bright, eager, almost hungry.

"You got them!" He hurries forward and examines the vial, turning it this way and that. The golden liquid shimmers in the fading light. "Magnificent. Absolutely magnificent. One down, two to go."

He hands the vial back to you with a smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes.

"Next: the Whispering Caves. We need moonstone—a rare crystal that grows deep underground, far from any source of light. Without sunlight or moonlight, the stone absorbs pure darkness and transforms it into something... useful."

He pulls a battered lantern from his bag and presses it into your hands.

"But beware. The caves are home to shadow wraiths. They feed on fear itself. The more frightened you become, the stronger they grow." His voice drops to a whisper. "This lantern will help keep them at bay. Guard its flame with your life."

Three more days of travel. Through forests thick with fog. Across a bridge spanning a bottomless gorge. Until at last you stand before a yawning cave mouth carved into the side of a mountain.

Darkness waits inside. Absolute darkness.

You light the lantern. Its flame burns steady and warm.

You descend.

The whispers begin almost immediately—soft, insistent, coming from everywhere and nowhere. They speak your name. They speak your fears. They know things they shouldn't know.
