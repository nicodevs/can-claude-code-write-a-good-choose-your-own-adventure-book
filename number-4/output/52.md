You grip the lantern tighter and push forward. The flame dances but holds steady, casting a small circle of golden light against the endless dark.

The whispers curl around you like smoke.

*You'll never save him.*

*He's already dead.*

*Your mother wept when you left for the academy. Did you know that?*

You know what they're doing. Shadow wraiths feed on fear—Corvus told you as much. The more you listen, the more power you give them. So you don't listen. You focus on the lantern. On the flame. On putting one foot in front of the other.

The cave descends deeper. The air grows cold and damp, pressing against your skin like wet cloth. Hours pass—or maybe minutes. Time loses meaning in this place.

*Aldric never believed in you. Not really.*

You clench your jaw and keep walking.

Then you see it.

A faint glow ahead, pale blue against the absolute darkness. Moonstone. It clings to the cavern wall like frost, pulsing with captured shadow-light. Beautiful and strange.

You approach carefully and pull out your wand. A breaking spell should crack it free from the rock. You focus your energy, feeling the magic drain from your core—the cooling spell at the Ember Peaks, the speed spells on the journey, all of it catching up to you now.

"Fractura," you whisper.

The spell hits the wall with a sharp crack. A chunk of moonstone breaks free and tumbles into your waiting hand. Cold as ice. Glowing softly.

The moment your fingers close around it, the temperature drops.

The shadows move.

Shadow wraiths materialize from the darkness—formless, hungry, their shapes shifting and writhing like living smoke. Dozens of them. Maybe more. Their whispers rise to a shriek.

"Lumos maxima!" you shout.

White light explodes from your wand. The wraiths scatter, screaming, dissolving like mist in sunlight. But you know it won't last. They're already reforming in the distant corners of the cave.

You cast a speed spell and run.

Your legs burn. Your lungs scream. The lantern swings wildly in your grip, its flame guttering but refusing to die. Behind you, the whispers grow louder, closer, hungry.

The cave exit appears ahead—a distant circle of gray light.

You burst into daylight and collapse onto the grass, gasping, trembling, alive.
