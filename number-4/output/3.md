You crouch behind the boulder and whisper the incantation. "Invisibilis."

The spell washes over you like cold water, and you watch your hands fade from sight. Your body follows, becoming transparent, then nothing at all. You can feel the magic draining from your reserves—a slow, steady pull that reminds you this won't last forever.

Heart pounding, you step out from your hiding place and walk toward the gate.

The cultists stand in pairs, their hooded faces turned toward the road. One of them clutches a staff crackling with dark energy. The other holds a curved blade at his hip. They don't see you. Can't see you.

You slip between them, close enough to smell the incense on their robes.

One of them stiffens. His hooded head turns in your direction, as if sensing something wrong in the air. Your breath catches in your throat. You freeze, not daring to move a muscle.

He stares at the empty space where you stand. His companion notices and looks too.

"Something wrong?" the second cultist asks.

A long, terrible pause.

"Nothing," the first one says finally. "Just the wind."

They turn back to their posts.

You exhale slowly and continue through the gate, your invisible feet making no sound on the ancient stone.

Inside, the Shadow Fortress is a labyrinth of dark corridors lit by green torches that cast sickly shadows on the walls. The stone is black as coal, veined with something that pulses like living darkness. Tapestries bearing Malachar's sigil hang from the walls, and everywhere you look, more cultists walk in silent procession.

You follow the sound of chanting. It echoes through the corridors, growing louder with each step—a low, droning voice speaking words in a language that makes your skin crawl.

Deeper. Deeper into the fortress.
