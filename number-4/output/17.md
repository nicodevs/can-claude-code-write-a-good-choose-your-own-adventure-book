You try to fight. Try to scream. But darkness floods your mind like black water filling a sinking ship. Your wand slips from numb fingers. Your legs buckle.

The last thing you feel is cold. Terrible, endless cold.

When you wake, you're different.

Your skin is pale as moonlight. Your heart no longer beats. And you're so very, very hungry.

The vampire lord stands before his throne, watching you with glowing red eyes. A smile plays across his sharp features.

"Welcome to eternity, my newest spawn."

You try to remember why you came here. A teacher. A dragon. A quest. But the memories feel distant now, like dreams fading in morning light. What matters is the hunger gnawing at your insides. What matters is the thirst.

"You will serve me," the vampire lord says, "as all my children serve me. Forever."

You kneel before him. You have no choice. The curse that flows through your veins demands obedience.

Somewhere far away, Archmage Aldric waits for a rescue that will never come. Malachar the Dread drains his magic day by day. And you? You haunt these crypts for centuries to come, feeding on travelers foolish enough to stumble into your domain.

You wanted to be a hero. Instead, you became a monster.

**THE END**
