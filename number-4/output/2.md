You spot your target: a lone golem patrolling near a massive furnace at the far end of the factory. Its iron body gleams dully in the ember-light, steam hissing from its joints with each thunderous step.

Time to get its attention.

You raise your wand and aim at a pile of scrap metal across the room. "EXPLODUS!"

The explosion tears through the silence, sending twisted iron and sparks flying in every direction. The blast drains your already depleted reserves, but it works. The golem's head swivels toward the noise, glowing runes pulsing brighter on its chest.

Then it sees you.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

The golem charges, each footstep shaking the factory floor. You turn and sprint toward the furnace, casting a speed spell as you run. "VELOCITAS!"

Magic surges through your legs, warm and electric, pushing you faster than your body should move. But the golem is fast too—impossibly fast for something made of solid iron. You can hear its joints screaming, feel the vibrations of its approach through the soles of your boots.

The furnace looms ahead. Its mouth yawns open, filled with glowing coals and shimmering heat waves. You can feel the temperature rising with every step.

Ten feet. Five.

The golem's iron hand swipes at your back. You feel the wind of the near miss.

NOW!

You dive to the side, rolling across scorched stone, your energy reserves nearly empty. The golem can't stop. Ten feet of solid iron, momentum carrying it forward like a runaway train.

CRASH!

Metal screams against metal as the golem slams into the furnace. Coals scatter. Flames roar to life, licking at its iron body. The golem thrashes, trying to pull itself free, but its feet have melted into the molten floor.

You watch, gasping for breath, as its body begins to glow. First dull red. Then orange. Then white-hot.

You gather what little strength remains and level your wand at its chest. "IMPACTUS MAXIMA!"

The force spell slams into glowing metal. With a shriek of tearing iron, the golem's chest cracks open like an egg.

There. Nestled among the molten wreckage. A crystal heart, pulsing with blue light.

You don't hesitate. You reach into the furnace, ignoring the searing pain as heat blisters your hands, and rip the crystal free. The golem shudders once and collapses, nothing more than a heap of cooling metal.

You stumble away from the furnace, clutching the crystal heart to your chest. Your hands are burned. Your magical reserves are utterly spent. But you have it.

All three components. The serpent hair. The vampire fang. The golem heart.

Now you just need to rest. To recover. To prepare for what comes next.

You find a shadowed corner of the factory, away from the other patrolling golems, and let exhaustion claim you. Sleep comes fast and dreamless.
