You move quickly, arranging the three components in a triangle around you on the cold stone floor. The serpent hair. The vampire fang. The golem heart. Each one pulses with its own dark energy, casting strange shadows that seem to move on their own.

You pull the Codex Umbra from your pack and open it to the marked page. The words seem to writhe on the parchment, eager to be spoken.

You begin the incantation.

The effect is immediate. Dark energy swirls around you like a living thing, cold and hungry. The air crackles with power. The three components begin to glow—sickly green, blood red, electric blue—their energies spiraling upward and intertwining.

Behind you, Aldric stirs. His eyes flutter open, unfocused and weak.

"No," he whispers, his voice barely audible. "Don't... don't use black magic..."

But you continue. You have to. You've come too far to stop now.

The chamber trembles. Dust falls from the ceiling. The crystal above Aldric flickers and dims. Something is coming.

BOOM!

The wall explodes inward. Stone and shadow burst into the chamber as Malachar tears through the fortress like paper. His massive form fills the doorway, wings folded tight against his sides, scales blacker than midnight. Those coal-fire eyes fix on you with murderous fury.

"YOU DARE?" His voice thunders directly into your mind, bypassing your ears entirely. The force of it nearly breaks your concentration. "YOU DARE USE THE OLD MAGIC AGAINST ME?"

He lunges. His jaws open wide, revealing teeth like obsidian daggers. His claws carve trenches in the stone floor as he charges.

You hold your focus. Keep chanting. The ancient words pour from your lips as shadow magic erupts from your body in waves. The three components blaze brighter, their energies forming chains of pure darkness that reach toward the dragon.

Malachar's claws slash the air inches from your face. You feel the wind of their passing. Smell the sulfur on his breath.

The binding is working. But it's not enough. The spell is draining you faster than you expected, and Malachar is fighting it with every ounce of his ancient power.

You have a choice. You can hold focus and complete the incantation exactly as written—trusting the spell to work as intended. Or you can reach out with your magic, try to absorb some of the stolen power still swirling in that crystal above Aldric, and use it to strengthen the binding.

The second option might guarantee success. But absorbing Malachar's stolen magic... what would that do to you?
