Greed whispers in your ear. All that stolen power, swirling in the crystal above Aldric's head. What if you could take just a little? Channel it into the spell? Guarantee your victory?

You alter the incantation mid-syllable, reaching out with your will toward the pulsing crystal. The words twist on your tongue—familiar yet wrong, like a song played backward.

Power floods into you.

It's incredible. Intoxicating. Magic like nothing you've ever felt, rushing through your veins like liquid fire. Your spell blazes brighter. The chains of darkness surge toward Malachar with renewed fury.

The dragon screams. "NO!"

But something is wrong. The power keeps coming. You try to stop it, to close the connection, but it's like trying to stop a river with your bare hands. More and more magic pours into you—Aldric's stolen strength, the accumulated power of a dozen wizards, centuries of hoarded darkness.

Too much. Too much!

The ritual spirals out of control. Black energy explodes outward from your body in a devastating wave. The fortress shakes. Stone cracks. The crystal shatters into a million pieces.

Malachar shrieks as the binding chains wrap around him, dragging him toward the obsidian prison that materializes in the center of the room. But the chains have wrapped around you too.

"No!" you scream, clawing at the darkness. "This wasn't—I didn't—"

The last thing you see is Aldric's horrified face, his mouth forming your name. Then the obsidian prison swallows you whole.

Darkness. Complete and eternal.

You're inside the crystal with Malachar. You can feel his rage pressing against you, his hatred burning like a cold sun. You try to move. Try to speak. Try to scream.

Nothing works.

The academy buries the crystal deep underground, in a vault no one will ever open. They call you a hero. They don't know you're still aware inside, screaming silently into the void.

Forever.

**THE END**
