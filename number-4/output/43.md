"Wait!"

The voice stops you mid-stride. You spin around, hand on your silver dagger.

A figure hurries toward you through the smoke and chaos—Professor Corvus. His silver hair is disheveled, his green robes streaked with ash. But his eyes gleam with an intensity you've never seen before.

"I saw what happened," he says, catching his breath. "You have Aldric's compass. You're going after him."

It's not a question.

"I have to," you say.

"Then let me help." Corvus steps closer, lowering his voice. "I'm the academy's expert on ancient dragon lore. I know things about Malachar that no one else does."

You hesitate. "What kind of things?"

"There's a binding ritual," he says urgently. "An ancient spell that can trap Malachar—imprison him the way he was imprisoned before. But we need three components, and we need them quickly. Phoenix tears from the Ember Peaks. Moonstone from the Whispering Caves. Starlight essence from the Crystal Spire."

He counts them off on his fingers, each name heavy with meaning.

"I know where to find them all. I can guide you. But we must hurry—every moment we delay, Malachar grows stronger."

You study his face. Professor Corvus has always been somewhat mysterious, keeping to himself, rarely seen outside his office or the library. But he's never given you reason to distrust him.

Then again, neither had the dragon, until today.
