You thrust your wand forward and shout, "SOMNUS!"

Purple mist billows from the tip, flowing toward the vampire like a slow wave. It swirls around him, seeping into his nostrils, wrapping him in its drowsy embrace.

He inhales deeply.

Then he laughs.

"You think such weak magic can affect me?" His voice drips with amusement. "I've lived for five centuries, child. I've been struck by sleeping spells cast by archmages far more powerful than you. They tickled."

The mist dissipates harmlessly around him. Your stomach drops.

Before you can react, he moves. One moment he's ten feet away. The next, he's directly in front of you, his hand wrapped around your throat. He lifts you off the ground as if you weigh nothing at all.

Your wand clatters to the stone floor. Your legs kick uselessly in the air.

"You'll make a fine thrall," he whispers, his red eyes burning into yours. "Young. Full of magic. You'll serve me for eternity."

His fangs descend—curved, gleaming white in the dim wandlight still glowing from the floor.

You struggle. You claw at his arm. You try to scream. But his strength is absolute, ancient, utterly overwhelming.

The bite is cold. So cold. You feel your blood being drawn, your warmth draining away, your consciousness fading like a candle guttering in a winter wind.

When you wake, you are no longer yourself.

You kneel before your master's throne, head bowed, waiting for orders. Somewhere in the back of your mind, a voice screams about a teacher named Aldric, a dragon named Malachar, a quest left unfinished.

But that voice grows quieter every night. And you have eternity to forget.

**THE END**
