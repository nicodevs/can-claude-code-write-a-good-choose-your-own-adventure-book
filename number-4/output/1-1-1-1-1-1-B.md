Morning mist clings to the ruins like a funeral shroud.

You pass through the stone archway and immediately understand why they call this place the Petrified Gardens. Statues fill the landscape—dozens of them, perhaps hundreds. Men, women, children. Soldiers with swords half-drawn. Merchants caught mid-scream. A mother clutching an infant to her chest.

All of them turned to gray stone. All of them frozen in their final moment of terror.

The air smells of death and old magic. Your footsteps crunch on gravel and petrified leaves. Every shadow seems to move when you're not looking directly at it.

Then you hear it.

Hissing. Soft at first, like wind through dry grass. But there is no wind.

You grip your wand tighter and peer between two statues—a knight and the beast he was fighting when the medusa found them both. And there she is.

Serpents writhe where hair should be, each one alive and tasting the air with forked tongues. Her skin is pale as marble, her body draped in tattered robes. She moves between her victims with an almost loving grace, running stone fingers across their frozen cheeks.

She hasn't seen you. Not yet.

Your left hand finds the mirror shield strapped to your back—a precaution you remembered from your magical creatures class. Your right hand could draw your sword and cut a snake from her head before she knows you're there. Or you could try a sleeping spell first. Knock her unconscious from a distance.

Both are risky. But you didn't come this far to turn back.
