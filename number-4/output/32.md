You land in the academy courtyard at dusk, legs buckling beneath you. Students rush over, shouting questions, but you wave them off and stumble toward the Headmaster's tower.

Thornwick receives you in his study, his stern eyes widening as you describe everything—the flight through the storm, the Shadow Fortress, its exact location in the Blackspine Mountains.

"Remarkable," he says, stroking his silver beard. "Truly remarkable. You've given us invaluable intelligence." He rises from his chair. "I'll convene the faculty immediately. We'll organize a rescue team at once."

Relief floods through you. Finally, action.

But "at once" doesn't mean what you thought it meant.

Days pass. The faculty debates endlessly. Which wizards should go? What spells will work against shadow dragons? How many should stay behind to protect the students? Meanwhile, messages fly to allied schools, requesting aid. Reinforcements trickle in—powerful wizards, yes, but each one brings new opinions, new strategies, new arguments.

A week becomes two. Two becomes three.

You attend meeting after meeting, watching them talk while Aldric suffers. The compass around your neck grows colder with each passing day, its glow dimmer. You know what that means. His magic is being drained. He's dying.

"We need more time to prepare," Thornwick says when you confront him. "Rushing in unprepared will only get more people killed."

But how much time does Aldric have left?
