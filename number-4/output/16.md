You can't waste time with permissions and debates. Every moment spent talking is a moment Aldric's magic drains away, feeding whatever dark purpose Malachar intends.

Before dawn breaks, you're already packing. A change of clothes. Dried rations from the kitchen. Healing salves you pilfered from the infirmary. Your wand rests in its holster, charged and ready. Aldric's compass hangs around your neck, its needle pointing stubbornly north.

You slip out through the academy's hidden exit—a crumbling section of wall behind the greenhouse that older students whisper about but professors pretend doesn't exist. Cool morning air fills your lungs as you step into the forest beyond the grounds.

No one sees you go.

According to your studies, a medusa dwells in the Petrified Gardens to the east—ancient ruins swallowed by wilderness, where statues stand frozen in eternal screams. That's where you'll find the first component. A hair from her serpent crown.

The compass needle tugs north, toward Malachar's lair. But the Gardens call you east. First things first.

You walk for two days. Through forests where the trees grow so thick they blot out the sun. Across a rushing river that nearly sweeps you away before you manage to conjure a floating charm on a fallen log. Past villages that eye you with suspicion—a young traveler in academy robes, alone and armed.

On the second night, you camp within sight of a stone archway covered in dead vines. Beyond it, pale shapes rise against the moonlight.

The Petrified Gardens.

You barely sleep.
