You don't hesitate. Not even for a second.

You thrust your wand skyward and shout the incantation for flight. Magic surges through you, lifting you off the cobblestones. Wind roars in your ears as you rocket upward, chasing the shadow that stole your teacher.

The storm swallows you. Rain lashes your face. Lightning cracks so close you can smell the ozone, feel your hair stand on end. Below, Thornwood Academy shrinks to a cluster of flickering lights. Above, Malachar climbs higher into the churning clouds.

You push harder. Faster. Your robes whip behind you like a tattered flag. The compass burns against your chest where you've tucked it—its needle holding true, pointing always toward the dragon.

Then you see him. A massive silhouette against a flash of lightning. Those midnight-black scales. Those wings that seem to drink in the darkness around them. And clutched in one terrible claw, a figure in deep blue robes.

"Aldric!" you scream into the wind.

Malachar's head swivels. For one horrible instant, those coal-fire eyes lock onto yours. You see yourself reflected in them—small, insignificant, a moth chasing a hurricane.

The dragon's mouth curls into something that might be a smile.

"Little wizard," his voice booms through the thunder, "you dare follow me?"

He laughs. The sound rattles your bones, makes your teeth ache, nearly breaks your concentration and sends you tumbling from the sky. But you hold on. You grip your wand tighter and ready the most powerful spell you know.

Your heart hammers against your ribs. This is it. This is madness. You're a third-year student challenging an ancient shadow dragon.

But Aldric would do the same for you.
