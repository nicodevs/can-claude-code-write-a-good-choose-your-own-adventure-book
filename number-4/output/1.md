The log floats three feet above your palm, spinning lazily in the afternoon sun. You squint in concentration, willing it higher. Levitation spells are tricky—too much force and the object rockets away; too little and it drops like a stone.

"Nice work," says the student beside you. "You've almost got it."

Then the sky turns black.

You look up. The log falls, forgotten. All around the courtyard, students gasp and point toward the clouds. A shape moves within them—massive, impossibly large, blotting out the sun itself.

Wings. Scales as dark as midnight. Eyes that burn like dying stars.

Malachar the Dread.

The name rises in your throat but dies before you can speak it. Every student at Thornwood Academy knows the legends. The shadow dragon imprisoned centuries ago by the Archmages. The beast that nearly consumed the world in darkness.

He was supposed to be locked away forever.

The dragon descends through the storm clouds, and when he opens his jaws, what comes out is not fire alone but darkness—a torrent of shadow and flame that tears across the academy grounds. Students scream and scatter.

"Everyone, get back!"

Archmage Aldric rushes forward, his deep blue robes billowing behind him. Silver hair streams in the wind as he raises both hands. A shield of pure light erupts before him, brilliant and blinding. The dragon's breath crashes against it like a black tide against a lighthouse.

"Aldric," Malachar's voice rumbles like an earthquake. "I remember you."

"You should have stayed imprisoned," Aldric shouts back.

They clash—light against shadow, magic against fury. For a moment, you dare to hope. Aldric is one of the most powerful wizards alive. Surely he can—

But Malachar is too strong.

The dragon's claw sweeps through the fading shield and seizes Aldric around the chest. Your teacher cries out. His wand clatters to the ground as the beast takes flight, wings beating thunder into the sky.

"No!" you scream.

They disappear into the storm. Lightning flashes. And then something falls—tumbling end over end through the rain until it lands at your feet with a soft thud.

Aldric's compass. The enchanted one he always carries. It glows faintly in your trembling hands, its needle spinning wildly before settling on a single direction.

North. Toward the Blackspine Mountains.

Your heart pounds. You have to save him. But how?
