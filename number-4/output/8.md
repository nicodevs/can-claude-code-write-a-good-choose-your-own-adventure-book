You whisper the incantation for seeing invisible creatures. Magic drains from your already depleted reserves, leaving you feeling hollow and cold. But the spell takes hold, settling over your vision like a second skin.

Then you raise your wand and murmur, "Lumos minima."

A dim glow emerges from the tip—barely enough to navigate by, but it will have to do. You descend the stone steps slowly, each footfall echoing into the depths.

The crypt reveals itself in pieces. Coffins line the walls, stacked three high, their lids thick with dust. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling like curtains, brushing your face as you pass. The air tastes of decay and ancient earth.

At the far end of the chamber, a stone throne rises from the floor.

Someone sits upon it.

Pale skin. Sharp, angular features. Black clothing that seems to drink in what little light your wand provides. His eyes are closed. His chest does not rise or fall.

Then those eyes snap open.

Red. Burning red, like embers in a dying fire.

He's visible. Your spell worked. Good.

"A visitor," the vampire lord says. His voice is smooth as silk, cold as the grave. He doesn't move from his throne, but somehow he seems closer. "How delightful."

He inhales deeply, nostrils flaring. "I can smell your fear, young wizard. It's... exquisite."

He rises in a single fluid motion, and you see his fangs—long, curved, gleaming white against bloodless lips. He takes a step toward you. Then another. His movements are wrong somehow. Too fast. Too precise.

"You've come for my fang, haven't you?" His smile widens. "I can sense dark magic on you. The taint of the Codex Umbra. Such desperation. Such delicious desperation."

He's advancing. Faster now.

You have seconds to decide.
