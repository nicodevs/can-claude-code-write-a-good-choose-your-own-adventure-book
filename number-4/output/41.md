You wake to the smell of healing salves and the soft glow of enchanted candles.

Three days. That's what they tell you. Three days lost to dreamless sleep while your bones knit themselves back together and your magical reserves slowly refilled. Three days while Malachar did who-knows-what to Archmage Aldric.

You try to sit up. Pain flares through your ribs, and you fall back against the pillows with a gasp.

"Brave," says a voice beside you, "but reckless."

Professor Nightshade sits in a chair by your bed. Her long black hair falls across her gray robes like ink on stone. Her pale face betrays no emotion, but her dark eyes study you with something that might be respect. Or concern.

"Malachar nearly killed you," she continues. "A third-year student, challenging an ancient shadow dragon. The healers say it's a miracle you survived."

"I had to try." Your voice comes out as a croak. "Aldric—"

"Is still in the dragon's clutches. And you will not save him with recklessness alone." She leans closer, her voice dropping to barely a whisper. "If you truly want to rescue him, you'll need more than courage. You'll need knowledge. Dark knowledge."

Your heart beats faster. "What do you mean?"

"There's a section of the library forbidden to students. Black magic texts, kept under lock and seal. One of them—the Codex Umbra—contains a spell that might help. An imprisonment spell powerful enough to bind even a shadow dragon." Her eyes bore into yours. "But such magic comes with a price."

She rises, smoothing her robes. "The choice is yours. You could sneak into the forbidden section tonight, while the librarians sleep. Or you could do things properly and ask Headmaster Thornwick for permission." A ghost of a smile crosses her lips. "Though I suspect you already know which path you'll choose."
