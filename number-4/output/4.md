The iron golem foundry is hidden deep in the Blackspine Mountains.

You travel for days, following Aldric's compass north through increasingly hostile terrain. The forests give way to rocky slopes. The rocky slopes give way to jagged peaks that slice the sky like broken glass. The air grows thin and cold, each breath burning in your lungs.

Finally, on the fourth day, you descend into a valley of black stone and find it.

An abandoned factory, half-swallowed by the mountain itself. Massive chimneys rise from the earth like the fingers of a buried giant. Rusted gears and broken conveyor belts litter the entrance. The whole place reeks of old metal and something else—something that smells like lightning about to strike.

You slip inside through a collapsed wall.

The interior is cavernous. Massive furnaces line the walls, cold now but still radiating an ancient heat. Catwalks crisscross overhead, their metal walkways groaning in the wind that whistles through broken windows. And patrolling the factory floor...

Golems.

You count three of them. Ten feet tall, made entirely of iron, their joints hissing with steam as they move. Glowing runes pulse on their chests—the magical cores that give them life. Their footsteps shake the ground with each thunderous step.

You need one of those hearts. Just one.

But how do you destroy something made of solid iron?

Your eyes drift to the furnaces. Some of them still have embers glowing deep within. If you could lure a golem inside, the heat might weaken its metal enough to crack it open.

Or there's another option. You remember a spell from your advanced studies—electromagnetic magic, designed to overload magical constructs. It's dangerous and unpredictable, but it might fry the golem's core from the inside.

Both plans are risky. But you've come too far to turn back now.
