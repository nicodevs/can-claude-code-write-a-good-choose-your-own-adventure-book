You duck behind a rusted conveyor belt and point your wand at the nearest golem. The electromagnetic spell is complex, requiring precise wand movements and intense concentration. Your lips form the incantation.

"ELECTROMAGNETIS IMPACTUM!"

Lightning erupts from your wand—not a single bolt, but a web of crackling energy that wraps around the golem like a glowing net. The electricity courses over its iron body, seeking every seam, every joint, every gap in its construction.

The golem stops mid-stride. Its runes flare brighter. Brighter still. The light pulses like a heartbeat, faster and faster, the glow shifting from soft orange to blinding white.

Something is wrong.

You realize it too late. The spell isn't just overloading the core—it's destabilizing it. The golem's chest begins to crack, molten light spilling from the fissures like blood from a wound.

You try to run.

BOOM!

The explosion throws you backward. Metal shrapnel tears through the air in every direction. A shard of iron, still glowing from the heat, punches through your shoulder. Pain unlike anything you've ever felt rips through your body. You hit the ground hard, gasping, blood pooling beneath you.

The other two golems turn. Their glowing eyes lock onto your position. They've heard the explosion. They've seen you.

They advance.

You try to raise your wand, but your arm won't obey. The shoulder wound is too deep. Your vision blurs as the golems close in, their footsteps shaking the factory floor.

One of them raises its massive iron fist.

You see it coming. You can't dodge.

The furnace. You should have used the furnace.

**THE END**
