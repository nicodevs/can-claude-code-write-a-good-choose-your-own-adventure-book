You trust Thornwick. You trust the process. Surely twelve powerful wizards will succeed where one third-year student would fail.

So you wait.

Two more weeks crawl by. The compass around your neck grows colder every day until, one morning, its glow flickers and dies completely. You try not to think about what that means.

Finally, the rescue team is ready. Twelve wizards, armed with enchanted weapons and protective wards, march toward the Blackspine Mountains. You go with them, clutching the dead compass like a talisman.

You reach the Shadow Fortress at dawn. The team breaches the dragon's maw gate, spells blazing. You storm through corridors of black stone, cutting down shadow creatures, until you reach the draining chamber at the fortress's heart.

But there's no dragon waiting.

There's only a body on the floor. Deep blue robes. Silver hair. Brown eyes staring at nothing.

Aldric.

You drop to your knees beside him. His skin is gray, his lips blue, his face frozen in an expression of despair. Every drop of magic has been wrung from his body. He's not just dead—he's empty.

"Malachar fled two days ago," one of the wizards reports grimly. "He got what he came for."

The dragon, now powered by Aldric's immense magic, goes on to conquer three kingdoms before the Archmages finally stop him. Thousands die. Cities burn.

And you? You survive. You graduate. You become a wizard.

But you never stop seeing Aldric's face. Never stop wondering what would have happened if you'd acted sooner. You find your answers at the bottom of bottles, drinking to forget the teacher you failed to save.

The guilt never leaves you.

**THE END**
