A massive shadow dragon descends through storm clouds, breathing darkness and flame. Malachar the Dread. The ancient beast was imprisoned centuries ago, but somehow he's free. Archmage Aldric, your beloved teacher, rushes forward with a shield of light. The two clash in a battle of magic and fury. But Malachar is too powerful. The dragon seizes Aldric in his claws and takes flight. As they disappear into the storm, something falls from the sky and lands at your feet—Aldric's enchanted compass, glowing faintly and pointing north toward the Blackspine Mountains.",

Armed now, you rush back toward where Malachar flew. But minutes have passed. The dragon is gone. You clutch Aldric's compass—it points north. You've lost precious time. [BREAK] \"Wait!\" a voice calls. Professor Corvus approaches, the academy's expert on ancient dragon lore. Silver-haired, green-robed, eyes gleaming with urgency. \"I know how to save Archmage Aldric,\" he says breathlessly. \"There's a binding ritual that can trap Malachar.

Dangerous, but you're brave.\" He hands you a crystal vial and a map. \"Collect the tears when the phoenix weeps at dawn. Go now!\" [BREAK] You travel quickly, reaching the volcanic peaks at dawn. Heat shimmers off black rock. You hear a haunting cry—the phoenix. You climb toward the sound and find her: magnificent, wreathed in flame, weeping golden tears into a pool of lava. The tears evaporate unless collected immediately. You cast a cooling spell to approach the lava pool, energy draining. How do you collect the tears?",

[BREAK] You return to the academy. Corvus is waiting, eyes bright. \"Excellent work! One down, two to go. Next: the Whispering Caves for moonstone. It grows deep underground where no light reaches. But beware—the caves are home to shadow wraiths. They feed on fear.\" He hands you a lantern. \"This will help.\" You travel for days to the Whispering Caves. At the entrance, darkness beckons.

The golem cracks but doesn't fall. You push higher, exhausted. At the top, starlight essence pools in a crystal basin. You collect it in a vial. Three components secured. [BREAK] You return to Corvus, triumphant. He's in his office with the other two components. \"You've done it! Now we can perform the ritual and save Aldric!\" He takes all three components. His expression shifts—cold, calculating. \"Actually, these aren't for saving anyone. They're for Malachar's ascension ritual. I've been serving him for years.
