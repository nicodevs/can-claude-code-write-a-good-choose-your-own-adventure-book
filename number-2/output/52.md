You follow the compass needle northeast, taking buses and trains into the mountain territory. The dual-needle compass is uncanny—the second needle remains fixed on its direction no matter how you turn the device.

After traveling for several hours, you arrive at the old mining area. The compass needle points directly at a rocky hillside. You hike up, following the indication precisely.

You find an abandoned mine entrance, partially hidden by brush. The compass needle points directly into it. Your heart pounds with excitement.

Inside, the mine is dark and cold. You follow the compass deeper, taking branching tunnels according to its direction. Left, then right, then straight... the compass guides you like a supernatural GPS.

Finally, you enter a small chamber. The compass needle spins wildly, then settles pointing straight down.

You examine the floor and find loose rocks. Digging with your hands, you uncover a metal chest. You open it to find gold coins, jewelry, and a note: "Well done, seeker. You've proven yourself worthy of my fortune. - Captain Ironhook"

**THE END**

You've found the treasure using Captain Ironhook's own compass! Your trust in the artifact and your perseverance have paid off. Congratulations!
