You follow the main tunnel, staying on level ground. The passage is wide enough to walk comfortably, with old rails still visible on the floor. You pass several side chambers—tool storage, a break area with broken chairs, a small office with a collapsed desk.

After about fifteen minutes of walking, the tunnel begins to descend gradually. The air grows noticeably colder. You hear water dripping somewhere ahead.

The tunnel branches. To the left, a smaller passage with fresher-looking timbers and a sign that reads "Survey Extension - 1924." To the right, the main tunnel continues deeper, showing more age and wear.

You check your map. The treasure marking seems to align with the older, main tunnel. But the 1924 extension is interesting—that's after the mine was supposedly abandoned. Why would someone extend the mine then?

Which path do you take?
