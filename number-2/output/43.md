You duck behind a large rock formation, clicking off your flashlight and holding your breath. The footsteps grow closer. A beam of light sweeps across the chamber.

"I know someone's here," a voice calls. "I saw the flashlight. Look, I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm searching for the Ironhook treasure too."

You stay silent, watching. The figure enters the chamber—a woman in professional hiking gear, carrying what looks like metal detection equipment.

"Fine," she says. "Be that way. But you should know—there are two treasure hunters working this area. One of them is dangerous. If you're smart, you'll partner up with someone." She pauses, shining her light around. "I'm going to check the deep chambers. If you change your mind, that's where I'll be."

She leaves, her footsteps fading down a side passage.

You emerge from hiding. Do you trust her? You could follow her to the deep chambers, or go your own way toward the shaft 7B location you identified earlier.

What do you do?

* If you follow her to the deep chambers, turn to [page 61](./61.md).
* If you go to shaft 7B alone, turn to [page 60](./60.md).
