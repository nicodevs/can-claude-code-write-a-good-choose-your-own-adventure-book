You beach the kayak on a narrow strip of barnacle-covered rock and tie it securely. The climb up the cliff face is treacherous—handholds are slippery with spray, and the rock crumbles in places—but you make it to the first small cave.

Inside, it's barely larger than a closet. Your flashlight reveals old bottles, broken crates, and— your heart races—carved initials in the rock: "C.I. 1847." Captain Ironhook was here!

The cave continues through a narrow crack barely wide enough to squeeze through. Beyond it, you hear the sound of dripping water, echoing as if in a larger space. You could push through, but you'd be committed—the crack is too narrow to back out of easily.

Alternatively, you notice chisel marks on the cave floor, as if someone tried to dig or pry something up. Maybe the treasure was hidden right here, in this small cave?

What do you do?
