You kneel and examine the chisel marks more closely. Someone definitely tried to pry up these rocks. You pull out your pocket knife and work at the edges of a flat stone. It shifts!

With effort, you lever the stone up and aside. Beneath it is a hollow space, and inside—you catch your breath—a metal box, green with corrosion but intact.

You pull it out carefully. It's about the size of a shoebox, surprisingly heavy. The lid is sealed with what looks like tar or wax. You scrape it away and pry the lid open.

Inside, wrapped in oilcloth: gold coins! Dozens of them, gleaming dully in your flashlight beam. Beneath the coins, you find a folded letter. You read it by flashlight:

"This is but a fraction of my fortune. I leave it here for those clever enough to follow the moon. The true treasure awaits in the mountain's heart, where the iron bird points the way. - C.I."

You've found treasure—but not the main cache. You could take these coins and be satisfied, or continue following the clues to the mountains.

What do you do?

* If you continue to the mountains following the clues, turn to [page 56](./56.md).
