You exhale and squeeze through the narrow crack. Rock scrapes your shoulders and back. For a terrifying moment, you think you're stuck, but you push harder and pop through into a larger space.

You're in an impressive natural cavern. Your flashlight reveals a cathedral-like space with a high ceiling and smooth walls sculpted by ancient water. A pool of crystal-clear water reflects your light like a mirror.

And on the far side of the pool, on a natural stone shelf, you see them: three wooden chests arranged in a row.

Your heart races. But something seems wrong. The cavern is too perfect, too obviously a treasure room. And the pool—you notice the water is moving slightly, following some current. There might be underwater passages.

You could wade around the pool to reach the chests, or investigate the water first to understand what you're dealing with.

What do you do?
