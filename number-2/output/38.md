The old hotel is called the Harborview, though its sign is missing several letters. The door is locked, but a window on the ground floor is broken. You climb through carefully.

Inside, the lobby is dusty and abandoned. Faded wallpaper peels from the walls, and a grand staircase leads to upper floors. You find a door marked "Basement" behind the check-in desk.

The basement stairs creak under your weight. At the bottom, you find old storage rooms filled with broken furniture and moldy boxes. But at the far end, partially hidden behind a collapsed shelf, you see it: a hole in the wall, revealing a brick-lined tunnel.

You squeeze through and enter the tunnel system. It's surprisingly well-built, with arched brick ceilings and iron brackets where torches once hung. The tunnel branches ahead: left leads toward the waterfront, right heads uphill toward downtown.

According to the map, both directions were used during Prohibition. The waterfront tunnel would connect to smuggling operations. The downtown tunnel would lead to speakeasies.

Which way do you go?

* If you head toward the waterfront, turn to [page 48](./48.md).
* If you head downtown, turn to [page 49](./49.md).
