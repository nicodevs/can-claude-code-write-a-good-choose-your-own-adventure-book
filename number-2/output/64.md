You paddle close to the platform, reaching out to grab the chest. Your fingers close around the iron handle just as a surge of water lifts your kayak. The chest is heavy—heavier than you expected!

You pull hard, but the chest doesn't budge. It's either secured to the platform or just too heavy to lift from this position. You need better leverage.

The water is rising fast now, surging around the platform. You try to beach the kayak, but another wave hits, spinning you around. Water pours into the kayak!

You make a split-second decision: abandon the kayak and grab the chest. You haul yourself onto the platform as the kayak flips and is swept away by the current.

Now you're stranded on the platform with the chest, water rising all around you. But you can open the chest now. Inside: gold coins, jewelry, and— importantly—a waterproof map showing an exit tunnel at the top of the chamber!

You climb toward the indicated exit, chest contents in your pockets, and find a tunnel that leads to safety. You've escaped with the treasure!

**THE END**

You succeeded despite the danger! Quick thinking and determination have earned you Captain Ironhook's fortune. Congratulations!
