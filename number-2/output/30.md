You take the city bus to the mountains, the mine map clutched in your hand. After several transfers and a long hike from the nearest stop, you reach the abandoned Eagle's Peak mine.

The entrance yawns before you, dark and forbidding. You enter cautiously, flashlight in hand. The main tunnel is surprisingly intact, with old rail tracks still visible on the floor.

You follow the tracks deeper, counting side passages according to the map. One, two, three... the seventh side tunnel should be shaft 7B. You turn down it, boots crunching on loose gravel.

The tunnel descends steeply. After several hundred feet, you reach a junction. An old wooden sign, barely legible, shows "7B Depth 400" with an arrow pointing left, and "7C Depth 500" pointing right. Your map specifically mentions 7B, but you notice fresh scratch marks on the wall of the 7C tunnel—someone else has been here recently.

Which tunnel do you follow?

* If you follow the 7B tunnel as marked, turn to [page 60](./60.md).
* If you investigate the 7C tunnel with fresh marks, turn to [page 61](./61.md).
