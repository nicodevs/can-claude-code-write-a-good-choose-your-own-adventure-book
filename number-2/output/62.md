You examine the lift mechanism. It's a simple brake system—release the brake, and gravity lowers the cage. You test it carefully, loading some rocks onto the platform first. You release the brake slightly, and the cage descends smoothly. The mechanism still works!

You clear the platform, step onto it, close the safety gate, and release the brake. The cage begins to descend with a squealing of cables and pulleys. Down, down into darkness, the circle of daylight above growing smaller.

The descent feels eternal. Finally, with a shudder, the cage reaches the bottom—a tunnel opening about 400 feet below the surface. You step off gratefully.

You're in a main tunnel with tracks on the floor. To your left, the tunnel slopes downward into darkness. To your right, it leads to what looks like a storage area—you can see wooden crates and shelves.

The storage area might be where treasures were kept. But the downward tunnel might lead to deeper, more secret locations.

Which way do you go?
