You wait, sitting on the dock, watching the water level drop. The fisherman was right—the tide recedes dramatically, revealing barnacle-crusted rocks and tidal pools teeming with small crabs and anemones.

When the water is at its lowest, you climb down the rocks to the cave entrance. The main cave that was churning with water is now passable on foot, with only shallow pools remaining.

You wade in, flashlight in hand. The cave goes back about fifty feet, then slopes downward into darkness. The air is cold and smells of salt and decay. Your light catches something metallic ahead—you splash forward excitedly.

It's an old iron gate, corroded but still intact, blocking a tunnel that leads deeper. A massive rusted lock hangs from the gate. You could try to break the lock, or search for another way around—you notice gaps where the cave wall has partially collapsed near the gate's hinges.

What do you do?
