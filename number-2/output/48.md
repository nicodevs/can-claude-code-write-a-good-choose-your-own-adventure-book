You descend the stone steps into the basement. The air is thick with the smell of salt and rotting wood. At the bottom, your feet splash into cold water—it's flooded, but only a few inches deep.

The basement is large, with stone archways supporting the building above. Moonlight filters through cracks, creating silver patterns on the black water. You can see where the basement connects to the harbor—an old loading dock, now submerged.

You wade through the space, searching. In a corner, you find a metal door set into the wall, heavy and rusted. It has a wheel-lock, like on a ship's watertight door. You strain against it—the wheel is stuck fast.

But next to the door, someone has scratched words into the stone: "The vault holds more than coins. Seek the mountain's heart."

A clue! The treasure isn't here—it's in the mountains. But you've learned something valuable.

You also find several gold coins scattered on the floor, dropped or abandoned by previous explorers. Not a fortune, but something.

Do you:

* Take the coins and head to the mountains, turn to [page 52](./52.md).
* Try harder to open the vault door, turn to [page 50](./50.md).
