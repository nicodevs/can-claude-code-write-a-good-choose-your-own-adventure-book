The curator leads you through a door marked "Staff Only" into a cluttered storage room. Shelves overflow with artifacts wrapped in bubble wrap and tissue paper. He guides you to the back corner, where a large bronze bell sits on a wooden pallet.

"The Serpent's Tooth's ship bell," he announces. "Divers found it in 1963, about two miles offshore."

The bell is beautiful despite its age, covered in verdigris and barnacles. You circle it slowly, examining every inch. Then you see it—on the inside of the bell, barely visible, something is carved into the metal: coordinates.

Your hands shake as you write them down: 42°15'33"N, 71°08'19"W.

"Did anyone ever check these coordinates?" you ask.

The curator shrugs. "No one noticed them before. The bell was displayed right-side-up for decades."

You pull out your phone and enter the coordinates into a mapping app. They point to a location in the mountains, near the old mining territory.

Do you:

* Head immediately to the coordinates, turn to [page 54](./54.md).
* Research the mining area first, turn to [page 55](./55.md).
