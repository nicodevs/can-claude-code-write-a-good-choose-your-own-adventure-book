You sprint forward as rocks begin to fall behind you. Debris crashes down, filling the tunnel with dust and noise. You run blindly, one arm protecting your head, until the rumbling stops.

When you finally stop and look back, the tunnel behind you is completely blocked. There's no going back that way. You're committed now.

You press forward, coughing in the dust. The tunnel slopes downward, then levels out. You emerge into a large chamber that takes your breath away.

It's a vault room. The walls are lined with wooden shelves, and on those shelves: treasure. Gold bars stacked like firewood. Chests overflowing with coins. Jewelry draped over hooks. Artifacts that belong in museums.

On a pedestal in the center sits a brass-bound journal. You open it to the first page: "The Private Fortune of Captain Ironhook. To whoever reads this: you've proven yourself worthy."

You've found it! The main treasure cache!

**THE END**

You've successfully discovered Captain Ironhook's treasure vault! Despite the danger, you persevered and claimed your reward. Congratulations!
