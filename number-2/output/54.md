You immediately head to the coordinates carved inside the bell. The journey takes most of the day—buses, then a train, then a long hike into the mountains.

Your phone's GPS guides you to the exact location: a rocky clearing on the mountainside. At first, you see nothing unusual. Just rocks, scrub brush, and a few stunted trees.

But as you explore, you find something: a stone cairn, man-made, partially hidden by vegetation. You carefully dismantle it.

Beneath the rocks, there's a metal plate set into the ground. It's weathered but solid. You clear away dirt and find a handle. With effort, you lift it—it's a hatch, revealing a ladder descending into darkness.

You climb down carefully. At the bottom, you find a small underground chamber, clearly man-made. The walls are stone, the floor flat. And in the center: three chests.

You open the first chest: gold coins. The second: jewelry and gemstones. The third: artifacts—old weapons, a sextant, a captain's hat.

A plaque on the wall reads: "To whoever finds this place by my secret marks, enjoy your reward. - Captain Ironhook, 1847"

**THE END**
