The Maritime Museum occupies a restored captain's mansion overlooking the harbor. Inside, ship models in glass cases line the walls, and the smell of old wood and brass polish fills the air.

You approach the curator, a thin man with wire-rimmed glasses, and explain you're researching Captain Ironhook. His eyebrows rise with interest.

"We have a small exhibit on local pirates," he says, leading you through a doorway. The room contains faded wanted posters, rusted weapons, and—you catch your breath—a portrait of a stern man with a hooked hand prosthetic. "Captain Ironhook himself."

The curator points to display cases. "We have his personal effects: his compass, his log book, and this—a brass key. We've never found what it unlocks." The key hangs on a velvet display.

He notices your excitement. "There's also a ship's bell from the Serpent's Tooth in our storage area. It was recovered by divers years ago. I could show you, if you'd like."

Which do you examine more closely?

* If you ask to see the ship's bell, turn to [page 27](./27.md).
