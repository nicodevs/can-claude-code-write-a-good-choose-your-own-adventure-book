You head north from the coast, following the clue about the "iron bird." You research weather vanes in the area—many old buildings have them, but you're looking for an eagle shape.

After asking around in several towns, you hear about an old building in Pinewood village that has a distinctive eagle weather vane. It's a former trading post, now abandoned, on the north end of town.

You find the building—a weathered wooden structure, its eagle weather vane still perched on the roof, though bent and rusty. The building is locked, but a window is broken.

Inside, you search systematically. In the back room, you find a trapdoor under a rotted rug. Below is a cellar with another door, this one made of iron.

The iron door is locked, but you notice the lock mechanism has an unusual shape—like it was designed for a specific, non-standard key. You remember the clue from the cave mentioned a "first key."

You search the cellar and find, hidden in a crevice: a brass key with an ornate hook design.

It fits! The door opens to reveal a tunnel that leads into the mountain.

You follow the tunnel to its end, where you find the treasure chamber.

**THE END**

You've successfully followed the chain of clues to Captain Ironhook's treasure! Congratulations!
