You duck under the weathered warning sign and enter the main shaft. Your flashlight beam cuts through absolute darkness. The tunnel is supported by timber beams that creak ominously. Your footsteps echo on the rocky floor.

The air grows colder as you descend. After about fifty yards, the tunnel branches. To the left, you see rusted mining equipment—an old cart on rails, pickaxes, and shovels propped against the wall. To the right, the tunnel continues deeper, sloping downward. You notice fresher-looking marks on the right tunnel wall, as if someone recently scraped away dirt or moss.

You consult your map by flashlight. The treasure marking seems to indicate a lower depth, which would mean taking the right path. But the equipment on the left might include tools that could be useful.

Which way do you go?

* If you explore the left tunnel with the equipment, turn to [page 40](./40.md).
* If you continue down the right tunnel, turn to [page 41](./41.md).
