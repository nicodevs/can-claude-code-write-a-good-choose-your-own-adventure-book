The bus rumbles along the coastal highway, ocean spray occasionally misting the windows. You press your face against the glass, watching seagulls wheel and cry above the churning gray-blue water. After an hour, you arrive in Harbortown.

The village clings to the rocky coastline like a barnacle. Weathered boats bob in the harbor, their hulls painted in fading reds and blues. The air tastes of salt and seaweed. You pull out your map and study the cave markings.

An old fisherman sits on the dock, mending a net with gnarled, weathered hands. He might know something about the caves. Alternatively, you notice a small boat rental shack at the end of the pier—you could rent a kayak and explore the coastline yourself.

The afternoon sun begins its descent toward the horizon. You'll need to choose soon.
