The town of Harbortown spreads up the hillside from the docks. You climb narrow streets until you find the historical society, housed in a Victorian building with peeling paint.

Inside, you meet Mr. Graves, a retired history teacher who volunteers there. When you mention Prohibition tunnels, his face lights up.

"Oh yes! The whole downtown is honeycombed with them. They connected speakeasies to the waterfront." He pulls out a hand-drawn map. "This entrance here"—he points—"is accessible through the basement of the old hotel. This one is in the town hall's foundation. Both should lead to the main tunnel network."

"Have people explored them?" you ask.

"Some. But they're dangerous—prone to flooding, poor air quality. The town sealed most entrances years ago." He looks at you seriously. "I really shouldn't encourage this, but if you're determined... the hotel basement might be safer. The town hall entrance has reported rockfalls."

Which entrance do you try?
