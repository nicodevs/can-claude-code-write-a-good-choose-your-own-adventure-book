You climb down the metal ladder, testing each rung carefully. It's slow going, but safer than trusting the ancient lift mechanism. Down and down you go, arms aching, until finally your feet touch solid ground.

You're at the bottom of the shaft, at a junction of several tunnels. Your flashlight reveals options in multiple directions. But one tunnel catches your attention—it has a mark carved into the stone above it: a hook symbol, crossed with an anchor. Captain Ironhook's signature!

This must be the right way. You enter the tunnel, following it as it winds deeper into the mountain. The air grows colder. Eventually, the tunnel opens into a small room that looks like it was carved specifically as a hiding place.

Inside: three chests arranged against the wall, covered in dust and cobwebs. You approach the first one, heart pounding. You lift the lid.

Gold! The chest is filled with gold coins, jewelry, and precious stones. The other two chests contain similar treasures, plus artifacts and old weapons.

A plaque on the wall confirms it: "The Fortune of Captain Ironhook - May it bring you prosperity - 1847."

**THE END**

You've successfully found the treasure through careful, safe choices! Your patience and caution have been rewarded. Congratulations!
