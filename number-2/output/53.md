You spend hours at the library researching "mountain keeper." Finally, in an old county history book, you find it: "The Mountain Keeper was a title given to the superintendent of the Pinewood Mine in the 1840s. The position was held by Silas Blackwood from 1844-1851."

Silas Blackwood! You search for more information about him. You discover he built a house on the mountain overlooking the mine—a stone cottage that still stands, now part of a small historical park.

The next day, you visit the cottage. It's been preserved as a museum, though rarely visited. A volunteer caretaker shows you around. When you ask about Captain Ironhook, her eyes widen.

"There's a legend," she says. "Silas Blackwood supposedly helped Ironhook hide something in the mine. But Blackwood kept a key in this very cottage."

She shows you a display case containing Blackwood's personal effects. Among them: an old iron key with an unusual design—a hook shape.

"It's never fit any lock we've found," she admits.

You examine the key through the glass. It must unlock something in the mine!

Do you:

* Ask to borrow the key and search the mine, turn to [page 60](./60.md).
* Research more about Blackwood's specific involvement, turn to [page 61](./61.md).
