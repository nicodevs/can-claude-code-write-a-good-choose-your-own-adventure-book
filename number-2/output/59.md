You gather the remaining gold coins—there are about twenty of them, heavy and real. You examine them by flashlight: they're genuine antique coins, each one valuable to collectors.

You carefully place them in your backpack. This isn't the legendary mother lode, but it's still a significant find. These coins could pay for college, or help your family, or fund future adventures.

Looking at the "decoy" message again, you realize the main treasure is probably in the mountains, far away. That would be a much bigger, more dangerous expedition. And you've already found something valuable.

Sometimes knowing when to be satisfied is the mark of wisdom. You leave the cave, kayak back to shore, and return home.

You sell the coins to a reputable collector, making enough money to significantly change your life. You frame your treasure map on the wall—a reminder of your adventure.

**THE END**

You've found a valuable treasure and made a wise decision! Not every treasure hunter needs to find the biggest prize—sometimes a modest success is enough. Congratulations on your practical approach!
