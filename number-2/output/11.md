Pinewood Village is a cluster of log cabins and a few small shops built around a central square. Smoke curls from chimneys, and the smell of wood fires mixes with the scent of pine.

You enter the general store, where a bell jingles above the door. An elderly woman behind the counter looks up from her knitting. "Help you, dear?"

You show her the map. Her expression changes instantly. "Where did you get this?" Her voice is sharp but not unkind.

"My grandmother's attic," you explain.

She sets down her knitting. "I'm Martha Flynn. My grandfather worked in those mines. There are stories..." She hesitates. "Some say Ironhook paid the miners to hide something valuable deep in the shafts. But there was a collapse in 1923. Several tunnels were sealed off."

"Can I still get in?" you ask eagerly.

"There's the main entrance up Eagle's Peak Trail, but it's dangerous. Or..." She leans closer, "There's an old ventilation shaft on the north side of the mountain. Locals used it as a shortcut. It's risky, but shorter."

Which way do you go?
