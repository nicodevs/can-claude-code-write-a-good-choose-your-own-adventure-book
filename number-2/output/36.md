You find a heavy rock and bash it against the rusted lock. Once, twice—on the third strike, the lock shatters, pieces falling into the shallow water with a splash.

You pull the gate open. It resists, scraping across stone, but gives way. Beyond lies a tunnel that slopes upward. You wade through, water getting shallower, until you emerge into a dry passage.

The passage opens into a small chamber. And there, sitting against the far wall as if waiting for you all these years, is a wooden chest bound with iron straps.

Your hands shake as you kneel before it. The chest isn't locked—the latch is stiff but functional. You lift the lid.

Gold coins catch your flashlight beam. Jewelry—necklaces, bracelets, rings—sparkles beneath. Old paper money, probably worthless now. And at the bottom, a leather-bound journal.

You open the journal. It's Captain Ironhook's personal log. On the last page: "I die a rich man, knowing my fortune is safely hidden. May it bring joy to whoever proves clever and brave enough to claim it."

You've found the treasure!

**THE END**

You succeeded! You've found Captain Ironhook's hidden treasure. Congratulations on your adventure!
