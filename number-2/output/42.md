"Hey!" you call back. "I'm just exploring! I found a map!"

A figure emerges from the tunnel—a girl about your age, wearing hiking gear and a headlamp. She looks relieved, not threatening.

"Oh thank goodness," she says. "I thought you might be—never mind. I'm Alex. I've been searching for the Ironhook treasure for three months."

You introduce yourself and show her your map. Her eyes widen. "That's the original! I've only been working from a photocopy." She shows you her version—it's less detailed than yours, missing some of the symbols.

"We should work together," she suggests. "I've mapped most of the mine system. There are two promising locations: a deep chamber at the 500-foot level, and an old vault room that was sealed up near shaft 7B. Your map might tell us which one."

You compare notes. Both locations seem possible.

Which do you investigate together?

* If you head to the deep chamber, turn to [page 61](./61.md).
* If you search for the sealed vault room, turn to [page 60](./60.md).
