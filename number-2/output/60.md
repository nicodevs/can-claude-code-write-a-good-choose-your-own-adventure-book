You follow the tunnel marked 7B. The passage is narrow and descends steeply. Water drips from the ceiling, and the air feels heavy and damp. Your flashlight reveals old timber supports and rusted equipment left behind decades ago.

After several minutes of careful descent, you reach a wider chamber. The ceiling is higher here, and you can see evidence of extensive mining—drill holes, blast marks, scattered rock debris.

At the far end of the chamber, you spot something that makes your heart race: an iron door set into the rock face, partially hidden behind a rockfall. You clear away the loose stones.

The door is locked, but the lock is old and corroded. You examine it closely and notice something—the keyhole has an unusual shape, like a hook. You remember the brass key from the museum!

But you don't have that key. However, you might be able to break the lock or pry the door open with tools.

You find an old crowbar among the abandoned equipment. With effort, you wedge it into the door frame and pull. The door groans, the rusted hinges protest—and then it swings open!
