The curator carefully removes the compass and logbook from their case. The compass is brass, tarnished green with age, and still functional—the needle swings to point north. But you notice something odd: there's a second, smaller needle underneath the main one, currently pointing northeast.

"We've never understood that second needle," the curator admits.

You open the logbook. Most entries are routine sailing notes, but the final entry, dated the day before the ship reportedly sank, reads: "Storm approaching. Secured cargo in the safe harbor. Key entrusted to the mountain keeper. May fortune favor the bold."

Safe harbor? Mountain keeper? You compare this to your map. The northeastern direction from the museum would point toward... you trace the line... the old mining area!

"This is incredible," you breathe. The dual-needle compass might be a directional tool specifically for finding the treasure.

Do you:

* Follow the compass northeast toward the mountains, turn to [page 52](./52.md).
* Research what "mountain keeper" might mean, turn to [page 53](./53.md).
