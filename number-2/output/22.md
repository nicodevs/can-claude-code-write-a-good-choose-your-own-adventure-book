Following Martha's directions, you hike up Eagle's Peak Trail until you reach the main mine entrance. It's imposing—a gaping dark mouth in the mountainside, with old timber supports and rusted rails leading into blackness.

You step inside, clicking on your flashlight. The beam illuminates decades of abandonment: collapsed timbers, pools of stagnant water, and the skeletal remains of mining equipment. The air is musty and cool.

The main tunnel extends straight ahead, but you also notice a shaft heading downward—wooden stairs descending into deeper darkness. The stairs look precarious, with several broken steps visible.

Your map suggests the treasure is at depth, but the main tunnel might lead to a safer route down. The stairs would be faster, if they hold your weight.

Which route do you take?

* If you follow the main tunnel, turn to [page 44](./44.md).
* If you risk the wooden stairs going down, turn to [page 45](./45.md).
