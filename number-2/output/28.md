You enter the cave marked with the crescent moon. The tunnel is narrow at first, forcing you to turn sideways, but it opens into a larger chamber. Your flashlight reveals stunning rock formations—stalactites dripping from the ceiling like frozen waterfalls.

But you're not here for geology. You search systematically, running your hands along the walls, looking for hiding spots or clues. The cave seems natural, untouched.

Then, near the back, you find it: a niche carved deliberately into the rock wall, about chest height. Inside sits a small wooden box, incredibly old, the wood almost black with age. Your heart pounds as you reach for it.

You open the box carefully. Inside, wrapped in oilcloth, is a letter. The paper crackles as you unfold it. Written in faded ink:

"To the clever soul who followed the moon, you've found the first key. The treasure lies where mountain meets sky, guarded by stone and depth. Follow the iron bird north."

Iron bird? You turn the letter over. On the back is a crude drawing of a weather vane shaped like an eagle.

Do you:

* Head north to find the weather vane, turn to [page 56](./56.md).
* Search the cave more thoroughly for other clues, turn to [page 57](./57.md).
