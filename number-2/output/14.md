Armed with your research, you take a bus to the coastal area marked "Smuggler's Hollow" on the old maps. The landscape is rugged and beautiful—waves crash against dark rocks, and seabirds nest in the cliff faces.

A hiking trail leads down to sea level. You follow it carefully, watching for loose stones. At the bottom, tide pools reflect the sky like scattered mirrors. Three cave openings yawn in the cliff face, each large enough to walk into.

You pull out your map and compare it to the scene. According to the newspaper article, smugglers used coded markings to identify the right cave. You examine the rock faces and find them: symbols scratched into stone, weathered but visible.

The left cave has a crescent moon symbol. The middle cave shows crossed lines. The right cave displays a rough star shape.

Your map shows a crescent moon next to one coordinate, and a star next to another. Which matches Captain Ironhook's treasure?

Which cave do you enter?

* If you enter the left cave (crescent moon), turn to [page 28](./28.md).
* If you enter the right cave (star), turn to [page 29](./29.md).
