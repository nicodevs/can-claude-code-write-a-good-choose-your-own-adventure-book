City Hall is an imposing granite building with marble floors that echo with every footstep. You navigate the corridors until you find the Records Department, a cramped office overflowing with filing cabinets and cardboard boxes.

The clerk, a middle-aged woman with reading glasses on a chain, listens to your request. "Mining records from the 1840s? That's going back a ways." She disappears into the stacks and returns with a dusty ledger.

You page through it carefully. Most entries are mundane—claims filed, equipment purchases—but then you find it: "Special deposit, secure storage, Ironhook account, shaft 7B, depth 400 feet. Access restricted."

The clerk peers over your shoulder. "Interesting. Shaft 7B was in the Eagle's Peak mine. It's abandoned now, but..." She pulls out a map of the mine system. "There were two ways into that shaft: through the main tunnel system, or via an old equipment lift that descended directly from the surface. The lift is probably rusted through by now."

Which route sounds better to you?
