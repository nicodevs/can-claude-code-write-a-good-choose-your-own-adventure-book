The customs house is smaller than the warehouse, built of gray stone with narrow windows. The metal door scrapes across broken tiles as you push inside.

The interior is a wreck—desks overturned, filing cabinets toppled and emptied, papers scattered everywhere. But unlike the warehouse, this place feels like it was abandoned in a hurry, not gradually forgotten.

You search through the debris and find something interesting: an old logbook, water-stained but readable. You flip through pages recording ships, cargo, and customs duties from the 1840s. And there—an entry for the Serpent's Tooth, Captain Ironhook commanding.

The entry shows the ship paid duties on "silk and spices" but there's a handwritten note in the margin: "Inspect cargo hold—discrepancy reported." Below that, someone scratched: "Vault access requested, key held by harbormaster."

A vault? You look around with new eyes. Could there be a vault in this building?

Do you:

* Search for a vault or hidden room in the customs house, turn to [page 50](./50.md).
* Look for records about the harbormaster's key, turn to [page 51](./51.md).
