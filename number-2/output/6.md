You approach Ms. Chen and carefully unfold the treasure map on the reference desk. Her eyes widen behind her reading glasses.

"Captain Ironhook!" she exclaims softly. "I haven't heard that name in years. Wait here." She disappears into the back room and returns with a leather-bound journal. "This was donated by the historical society. It's a ship's log from 1847."

She flips through brittle pages until she finds an entry. "Listen to this: 'Ironhook's ship, the Serpent's Tooth, was reportedly lost in a storm off the coast. But some say he made it to shore with his treasure.'" She looks at you over her glasses. "There are two places mentioned in the records: the old docks where smugglers used to operate, and the maritime museum, which has artifacts from that era."

You feel a tingle of excitement. This is real!

Where do you investigate first?

* If you visit the maritime museum, turn to [page 13](./13.md).
