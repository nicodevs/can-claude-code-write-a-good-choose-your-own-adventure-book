You tie your rope securely to the sturdiest tree you can find, test it with your full weight, then lower yourself into the shaft alongside the old ladder. The rope cuts into your hands even through your gloves, but you descend steadily.

About forty feet down, your flashlight catches something: an opening in the shaft wall, a horizontal tunnel branching off. The old ladder passes right by it. This must be one of the mine levels.

You swing over and grab the edge of the tunnel, pulling yourself in. Safe! You untie your rope and coil it up—you might need it later.

This tunnel looks well-used, with cart tracks on the floor and relatively intact timber supports. You follow it, checking your map periodically. According to your calculations, you should be approaching the area where the treasure is marked.

The tunnel opens into a small chamber, and you stop in amazement. The walls are covered in carved symbols—treasure maps, dates, initials. This must be where miners kept records of their findings.

And in the center of the chamber: a stone cairn with a brass plaque. You read: "Here lies the fortune of Captain Ironhook. Take what you find, with his blessing."

You dismantle the cairn and find a chest beneath!
