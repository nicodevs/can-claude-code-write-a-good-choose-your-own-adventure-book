You turn and sprint back toward the stairs. Rocks rain down behind you, some bouncing past you. A large stone strikes your shoulder, but you keep running.

You reach the stairs and pound up them, taking three at a time. Behind you, the tunnel collapses with a sound like thunder. Dust billows up the stairwell, choking and blinding you.

You burst through the basement door into the Town Hall hallway, gasping for air. A security guard rushing toward the noise stops and stares at you, covered in dust and dirt.

"What happened?" he demands.

You explain about the tunnel collapse. He calls for help, and soon the basement entrance is cordoned off with warning tape. The fire department arrives to assess the damage.

You're safe, but you've lost access to the tunnels. Later, you search through historical society records for other possible treasure locations, but find nothing promising. The Ironhook treasure remains hidden.

**THE END**

You escaped with your life, but the treasure remains undiscovered. Sometimes survival is the greatest treasure of all. Perhaps another day, another adventure will lead you back to the hunt.
