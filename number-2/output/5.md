The train rattles and sways as it climbs into the mountain range. Through the window, you watch the landscape transform from rolling hills to steep, pine-covered slopes. Snow-capped peaks pierce the clouds in the distance.

You arrive at Pinewood Station, a tiny wooden platform surrounded by towering evergreens. The air is thin and crisp, scented with pine sap and mountain flowers. According to your map, the old mine entrance should be a few miles up a hiking trail.

A hand-painted sign points to "Eagle's Peak Trail." Another weathered sign indicates "Pinewood Village - 1 mile" in the opposite direction. The village might have locals who remember stories about the old mining days, but following the trail directly would save time.

You adjust your backpack straps and look up at the mountains looming above.

Which path do you take?

* If you follow the trail immediately toward the mine, turn to [page 10](./10.md).
* If you go to Pinewood Village to ask locals first, turn to [page 11](./11.md).
