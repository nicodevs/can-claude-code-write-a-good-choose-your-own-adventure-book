You lower yourself onto the ladder carefully, testing each rung before trusting it with your weight. The metal is cold and flakes of rust come off on your hands. Some rungs are missing entirely, forcing you to stretch uncomfortably between secure holds.

Down, down, down you climb. Your arms burn with effort. The darkness is complete except for your flashlight beam. You can't see the bottom.

After what feels like forever, your foot finally touches solid ground. You're in a horizontal tunnel, part of the mine system. Water drips from the ceiling, and the air is cold and damp.

The tunnel heads in two directions. To your left, you hear the sound of flowing water—perhaps an underground stream. To your right, the tunnel is dry and shows signs of recent use—footprints in the dust, fresh scratch marks on the walls.

Someone else has been here recently. That could be good or bad.

Which direction do you go?

* If you follow the signs of recent activity, turn to [page 60](./60.md).
