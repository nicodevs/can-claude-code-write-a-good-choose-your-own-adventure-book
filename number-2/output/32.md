You paddle hard into the narrow passage. The walls close in around you, and you have to duck to avoid hitting your head on the low ceiling. Water surges beneath you, the incoming tide pushing you forward faster than you can control.

The passage opens suddenly into a large underground chamber. Your flashlight beam struggles to reach the far walls. The ceiling arches high above, covered in stalactites. And in the center of the chamber, rising from the water like an island, is a natural stone platform.

You paddle closer and see it: a chest, wooden and bound with iron, sitting on the platform!

But there's a problem. The tide is rising fast—water pours in from multiple tunnels around the chamber. You need to reach the chest quickly. You could paddle right up and grab it, or you could beach your kayak and climb onto the platform for a more secure footing.

The sound of rushing water grows louder. The tide waits for no one.

What do you do?
