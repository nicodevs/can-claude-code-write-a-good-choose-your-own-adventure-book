Armed with the clerk's information, you search for the old equipment lift. It takes hours of hiking around the mountain slopes, but you finally find it—a weathered wooden structure like a mining headframe, with thick cables disappearing down a vertical shaft.

The lift cage itself is still there, a metal platform surrounded by rusted safety rails. You test the cables nervously—they seem solid, held by some kind of brake mechanism. There's a manual crank that should lower the lift, but it would require significant strength.

Next to the lift, you notice a metal ladder bolted to the shaft wall, descending into darkness alongside the lift. The ladder looks more trustworthy than the ancient lift mechanism.

The sun is getting low. Descending into the shaft would commit you to being underground as darkness falls.

What do you do?
