The rental attendant, a teenager with sun-bleached hair, helps you into a bright yellow kayak. "Watch the tide," he warns. "It comes in fast around those caves."

You paddle along the coastline, arms burning with effort as you navigate the choppy water. The cliffs rise dramatically on your right, barnacle-covered rocks jutting from the foam. Seals watch you curiously from nearby outcroppings.

After twenty minutes, you spot it: a dark opening in the cliff face, partially hidden by a natural rock arch. This must be one of the caves marked on your map. Smaller caves dot the cliff further south, barely visible in the fading light.

The main cave looks large enough to paddle into, but the water rushes in and out with dangerous force. The smaller caves might be safer to explore, but you'd need to beach the kayak and climb.

Which do you choose?

* If you paddle into the large cave, turn to [page 16](./16.md).
* If you investigate the smaller caves by climbing, turn to [page 17](./17.md).
