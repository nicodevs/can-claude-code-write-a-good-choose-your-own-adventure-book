You decide to investigate the water first. You kneel at the edge of the pool and study it carefully. The water moves in a gentle current, flowing toward the far corner of the cavern. You follow the flow and discover a narrow channel where water exits—an underwater passage.

You shine your flashlight into the water. The passage looks navigable, maybe twenty feet long before it opens into another space. You can see light on the other side—not electric light, but what looks like daylight filtering down from above.

This could be an escape route, or it could lead to another chamber. Given that the three chests on the shelf might be decoys (they're awfully conspicuous), the real treasure might be through this underwater passage.

You take a deep breath and dive. The water is shockingly cold. You swim hard through the passage, lungs beginning to burn. You emerge gasping in another chamber—this one with a crack in the ceiling letting in daylight.

And on a raised platform, completely dry: the real treasure chest, protected from the water.

You open it to find Captain Ironhook's fortune.

**THE END**

Your caution and investigation paid off! You avoided the decoys and found the real treasure. Congratulations on your clever thinking!
