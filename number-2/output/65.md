Beyond the iron door (or in the storage area, or at the cairn—depending on your path), you find yourself in a carefully prepared treasure chamber. The room is dry and has been protected from the elements.

Along the walls, wooden shelves hold an impressive array of wealth: gold bars stacked neatly, leather bags full of coins, jewelry boxes overflowing with precious stones, and artifacts from around the world—Chinese porcelain, African ivory, Spanish silver.

In the center of the room sits a large chest—THE chest, you somehow know. It's made of dark wood bound with brass, and has Captain Ironhook's symbol carved deeply into the lid: a hook crossed with an anchor.

You open it reverently. Inside, more treasure, but also something else: a letter, sealed with wax. You break the seal and read:

"To whoever finds this place—you have proven yourself worthy through cleverness and courage. This fortune is yours. Use it well, and remember: the greatest treasure is the adventure itself. - Captain Ironhook, 1847"

You've done it. You've found the legendary treasure of Captain Ironhook!

**THE END**

Congratulations! Your adventure has led you to incredible riches. You've successfully completed your treasure hunt!
