You approach the fisherman, who looks up from his net with pale blue eyes. His face is deeply tanned and creased like old leather.

"Excuse me," you begin, showing him the map. "Do you know anything about these caves?"

He squints at the map, then nods slowly. "Aye. Smuggler's Hollow, we call 'em. Dangerous places. Tide comes in fierce." He points a crooked finger at specific markings. "This symbol here—that's the Devil's Throat. Cave goes deep, but there's underwater passages. Treacherous."

"And these others?" you ask, pointing to smaller cave symbols.

"Those're different. Shallow caves, but you'd need climbing gear. Some of 'em connect to old tunnels that run under the town. Built during Prohibition, they say." He peers at you seriously. "You looking for trouble, kid?"

You shake your head. "Just exploring."

He grunts. "If you're fool enough to go in those caves, best do it at low tide. That's in about an hour."

Do you:

* Wait for low tide and explore the underwater passages, turn to [page 18](./18.md).
* Head into town to find the old Prohibition tunnels, turn to [page 19](./19.md).
