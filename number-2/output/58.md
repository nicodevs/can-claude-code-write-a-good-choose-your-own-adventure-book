You note the compass direction and travel inland toward the mountains. After a long journey by bus and then on foot, you reach the mining territory.

Following the compass bearing, you hike up mountain trails until you're deep in the old mining area. The compass direction leads you to a distinctive rock formation that looks like a natural archway.

Beneath the archway, you find evidence of old digging—someone was here before, searching. But they must have given up. You dig deeper, using a sturdy stick to probe the ground.

Your stick hits something solid. Excited, you dig with your hands and uncover a metal box, about the size of a suitcase. It's locked with a rusted padlock.

You smash the lock with a rock. Inside the box: gold coins, yes, but also something more valuable—a detailed map showing multiple treasure caches! Ironhook didn't hide all his treasure in one place. This map shows three other locations.

You've found the master map! With this, you can find all of Ironhook's hidden fortunes.

**THE END**

You've discovered not just one treasure, but the key to finding them all! Your decision to follow the compass has led to the ultimate prize. Congratulations!
