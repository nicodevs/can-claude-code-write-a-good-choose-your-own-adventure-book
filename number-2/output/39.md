Town Hall is an imposing Victorian building. You slip in during business hours and find the stairs down to the basement level, pretending you belong there.

The basement is mostly used for storage now—filing cabinets, old computers, and boxes labeled with years. But in the back corner, you find what you're looking for: an old wooden door with a faded sign reading "Maintenance Tunnel - Authorized Personnel Only."

The door is unlocked. Beyond it, stone steps lead down into darkness. You descend carefully, clicking on your flashlight. The steps end in a tunnel that looks much older than the building above—rough-cut stone walls, wet and covered in moss.

You proceed cautiously. After fifty feet, you hear an ominous creaking sound. You look up just in time to see cracks spreading across the ceiling. Rockfall!

You have seconds to act.

Do you:

* Run forward deeper into the tunnel, turn to [page 50](./50.md).
* Run back toward the stairs, turn to [page 51](./51.md).
