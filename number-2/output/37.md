You squeeze through the gap where the wall has collapsed. Sharp rocks scrape your arms and legs, but you make it through. You're in a natural cave system now, beyond the man-made gate.

The cave slopes downward steeply. You proceed carefully, testing each step. The sound of dripping water echoes from multiple directions—this cave system must be extensive.

After several minutes of careful descent, you round a corner and stop in amazement.

The cave opens into a massive chamber, and in the center, illuminated by a shaft of daylight from a crack high above, sits an enormous treasure pile. Gold coins, silver ingots, jewelry, ornate weapons—it looks like something from a pirate movie.

But as you approach, you notice something wrong. The treasure is sitting in a depression, and water is slowly pooling around it. The tide is coming in through underwater passages. If you don't act quickly, the treasure will be submerged—and so will you.

You could grab as much as you can carry and retreat, or try to find another way out through the daylight crack above.

What do you do?
