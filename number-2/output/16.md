You take a deep breath and paddle into the cave's mouth. The temperature drops instantly. Water drips from the ceiling with hollow plinking sounds. Your kayak scrapes against submerged rocks.

The cave tunnel curves to the right, growing darker. You click on your flashlight, sweeping the beam across wet walls covered in barnacles and seaweed. The water churns beneath you—the tide is definitely coming in.

The passage splits: to the left, the tunnel narrows but continues deep into the cliff. To the right, you see a rocky ledge with what looks like iron rings bolted into the stone—old mooring points where smugglers might have tied boats.

You can hear the ocean surging behind you, and feel the kayak being pushed forward by incoming water. You need to decide quickly.

Do you:

* Continue deeper into the narrow left passage, turn to [page 32](./32.md).
* Pull up to the ledge with the iron rings, turn to [page 33](./33.md).
