Patience, you remind yourself. A good treasure hunter does their homework. You carefully fold the map and head to the town library, a grand old building with stone columns and squeaky wooden floors.

The cool, quiet interior smells of old paper and furniture polish. Towering shelves stretch toward the high ceiling. Ms. Chen, the librarian, sits at the reference desk, sorting through a cart of returned books.

You have two options for research: you could ask Ms. Chen directly about Captain Ironhook—she knows everything about local history. Or you could use the library's computer database to search historical records and news archives yourself.

Ms. Chen looks up and smiles at you. "Can I help you find something?"

What do you do?

* If you ask Ms. Chen about Captain Ironhook, turn to [page 6](./6.md).
* If you use the computer to research on your own, turn to [page 7](./7.md).
