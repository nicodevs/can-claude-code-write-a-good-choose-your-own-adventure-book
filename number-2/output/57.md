You decide to search the cave more thoroughly before leaving. You examine every inch of the walls, floor, and ceiling with your flashlight.

In a high corner, nearly invisible, you find more scratched letters: "The moon shows the way, but the treasure lies where the star shines brightest."

Star? You think about the three caves—moon, crossed lines, and star. The star cave! The treasure must be in the other cave after all. But the letter said this was the "first key," so maybe the moon cave holds a clue to access the star cave's treasure?

You search more frantically. Near where you found the letter box, you discover a loose rock. Behind it: a small brass key with a star symbol engraved on it.

You race back to the star-marked cave. Inside, beyond the decoy treasure chamber, you find a locked iron box embedded in the wall. The star key fits!

Inside the box: a map showing a completely different location—deeper in the cave system, through a hidden passage. You follow it and discover an incredible treasure cache.

**THE END**

Your thorough searching paid off! You found the real treasure by refusing to accept the first, obvious answer. Congratulations!
