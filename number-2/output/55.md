You decide to research the mining area before rushing in. Back at the library, you search through old mining records, geological surveys, and historical accounts.

You discover something interesting: in 1847, the same year Ironhook supposedly hid his treasure, there was a cave-in at the Pinewood Mine. Several tunnels were sealed off. The records mention that "personal storage vaults" were inaccessible after the collapse.

Personal storage vaults! Miners often kept valuables in secure areas of the mine. Ironhook could have rented or hidden his treasure in one of these.

You find a mining engineer's diagram from 1846 showing the location of the vaults: deep in shaft 7B, at approximately 400 feet depth.

Armed with this information, you travel to the mountains. You find the old mine entrance and descend carefully, following the diagram. The mine is dangerous—collapsed areas, bad air, unstable ground—but you press on.

Finally, you find it: an iron door set into the rock wall, rusted but intact. Using tools you brought, you break the lock.

Inside: Captain Ironhook's treasure.

**THE END**

Your careful research and preparation have paid off! You've found the treasure by understanding its history. Congratulations on your thorough approach!
