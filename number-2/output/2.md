You race down the attic stairs, map clutched in your hand. There's no time to waste—treasure waits for no one! You stuff some supplies into your backpack: a flashlight, rope, a water bottle, and some snacks.

Looking at the map more carefully, you see two possible starting points. One shows a coastal area with what looks like a cave system marked along the cliffs. The other indicates a mountain range about fifty miles inland, with a symbol that might represent a mine shaft.

The coastal route would mean taking the bus to Harbortown, a fishing village you've visited once before. The mountain path would require a longer journey by train, heading into territory you've never explored.

Both locations show weathered notations in the margin—coordinates and cryptic phrases in faded ink.

Which way do you choose?

* If you head to the coast to investigate the sea caves, turn to [page 4](./4.md).
* If you take the train into the mountains, turn to [page 5](./5.md).
