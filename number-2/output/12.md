The old docks district is a forgotten corner of the city. Abandoned warehouses lean at precarious angles, their windows broken or boarded up. Rusty chains and rotting rope litter the cracked pavement. The modern port lies miles away; this area hasn't seen legitimate business in decades.

You walk carefully, checking your map against the surroundings. A faded street sign reads "Ironhook Lane"—that can't be a coincidence. Two structures catch your attention: a massive brick warehouse with "HARRINGTON & SONS" painted in flaking letters, and a smaller stone building that might have been a customs house, its metal door hanging ajar.

Seagulls cry overhead. You hear water lapping against the old dock pilings.

Both buildings look abandoned, but something about them feels significant. The warehouse would have been large enough to hide cargo. The customs house would have official records.

Which do you investigate?
