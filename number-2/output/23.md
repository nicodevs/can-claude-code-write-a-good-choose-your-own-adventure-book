Martha draws you a rough map to the ventilation shaft. You hike around the north side of the mountain, pushing through dense underbrush and scrambling over fallen logs. After nearly an hour, you find it—a circular stone structure half-hidden by overgrown vines, like an old well.

You peer over the edge. Your flashlight beam disappears into blackness far below. An ancient iron ladder is bolted to the side, descending into the dark. Several rungs are missing, and the ones remaining are coated with rust.

This is more dangerous than you expected. But you've come this far. You test the ladder carefully—it holds, but barely. You could climb down, moving slowly and testing each rung. Or you could use your rope, tie it to a nearby tree, and rappel down beside the ladder for safety.

The sun is sinking toward the horizon. You need to decide.

What do you do?

* If you climb down the ladder carefully, turn to [page 46](./46.md).
* If you use your rope to rappel down, turn to [page 47](./47.md).
