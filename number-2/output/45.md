You test the wooden stairs carefully. The first few steps creak alarmingly but hold. You descend slowly, testing each step before putting your full weight on it.

About halfway down, a step breaks under your foot. You catch yourself on the railing—which groans but holds—and carefully climb over the gap. Your heart pounds.

The stairs end at a landing about fifty feet below the main tunnel. A heavy wooden door faces you, reinforced with iron bands. It's padlocked, but the wood around the lock is rotted.

You kick hard at the weak spot. Once, twice—on the third kick, the wood splinters and the entire lock assembly tears free. The door swings open with a horror-movie creak.

Beyond is a small room carved from the rock. And inside: three chests arranged against the far wall, a table with what looks like a logbook, and old mining equipment.

This looks like a private storage room. You approach the nearest chest and lift the lid. It's full of gold coins!

**THE END**

You've discovered Captain Ironhook's treasure! The three chests contain gold, jewelry, and artifacts worth a fortune. Congratulations on your success!
