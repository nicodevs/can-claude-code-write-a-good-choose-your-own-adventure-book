The dust makes you sneeze as you push aside an old trunk in your grandmother's attic. Golden afternoon light streams through the circular window, illuminating thousands of dancing particles. Your hand brushes against something papery wedged between two floorboards.

You tug it free. It's a map—yellowed with age, edges crumbling, but unmistakable. A red X marks a spot labeled "Captain Ironhook's Fortune." Your heart pounds as you trace the faded ink lines with your finger. Islands, compass roses, depth markers—this is real.

According to the map's legend, the treasure was hidden in 1847. That's almost two hundred years ago! Your mind races with possibilities. Gold coins, jewels, ancient artifacts—what could be waiting?

You clutch the map tightly. What do you do?
