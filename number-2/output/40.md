You take the left tunnel toward the equipment. The mining tools are old but some might still be useful. You examine a pickaxe—the handle is rotten, but the metal head is solid. You also find a coil of rope that seems intact, and an old oil lantern.

As you're investigating the equipment, you notice something strange: the wall behind the tool rack looks different. You push the rack aside with a screech of metal on stone.

Behind it is a boarded-up passage. The boards are old and partially rotted. You can see light—actual daylight—filtering through the cracks. This passage must lead outside!

You pry the boards away and squeeze through. The passage leads upward, twisting and turning, until you emerge on the mountainside in a completely different location from where you entered. You're higher up the slope now.

Looking around, you see a stone marker partially hidden by brush. You clear it away and read: "Property of Pinewood Mining Co. Shaft 7B - 200 yards north."

North from here! You've found a shortcut to the treasure location.
