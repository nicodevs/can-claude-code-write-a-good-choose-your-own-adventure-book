The warehouse door groans as you push it open. Inside, vast empty space stretches before you, lit by dusty shafts of light from broken skylights. Pigeons flutter in the rafters. The wooden floor is rotted in places, revealing the ground below.

You walk carefully, testing each step. Old crates are stacked against the walls, their contents long since removed or stolen. But as you explore, you notice something: a section of floor that sounds different when you walk on it—hollow.

You kneel and find a iron ring flush with the floorboards. A trapdoor! You pull hard, and it lifts with a shriek of rusty hinges. Below, stone steps lead down into darkness.

The stairs descend to what looks like a basement or cellar. You can smell salt water—it must connect to the harbor somehow. But it's pitch black down there, and you hear water lapping against stone.

Do you:

* Descend the stairs into the basement, turn to [page 48](./48.md).
* Search the warehouse level more thoroughly first, turn to [page 49](./49.md).
