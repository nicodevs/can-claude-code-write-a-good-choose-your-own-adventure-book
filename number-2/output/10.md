You hike up the trail, boots crunching on pine needles and loose gravel. The path winds steeply upward, switchbacking through dense forest. Your breath comes harder in the thin mountain air.

After an hour of climbing, the trees thin out. You emerge onto a rocky slope scattered with the ruins of old mining operations. Rusted equipment lies half-buried in the dirt—twisted metal rails, a broken ore cart, collapsed wooden structures.

Near the cliff face, you spot two openings: One is a proper mine entrance, its wooden support beams still intact though weathered gray with age. A faded sign warns: "DANGER - UNSTABLE." The other opening is partially collapsed, smaller, but you notice fresh scratches in the dirt nearby—someone else has been here recently.

The sun hangs lower in the sky. You'll need to choose carefully.

Which entrance do you explore?
