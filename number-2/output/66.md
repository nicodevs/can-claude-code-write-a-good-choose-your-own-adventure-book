You grab the crowbar (or try the combination, or grab treasure from the flooding chamber—paths converge here). With determination, you work at the lock or door or situation before you.

Success! The mechanism gives way with a satisfying click or crash. You've overcome the obstacle!

Inside or beyond, you find treasure—perhaps not the main cache, but significant nonetheless. Gold coins spill out, jewelry catches your flashlight beam, and artifacts of historical value are yours for the taking.

You fill your backpack with as much as you can carry. The treasure is heavy but exhilarating. As you prepare to leave, you notice an inscription on the wall or on a plaque: "Fortune favors the bold. - C.I."

You make your way back to the surface, treasure in hand. Later, you sell some of the items to museums and collectors, keeping a few special pieces as mementos. The money is life-changing—enough to secure your future and fund more adventures.

You didn't find the legendary mother lode, but you found enough to make your quest a success.

**THE END**

Congratulations! Your bold action has rewarded you with treasure and the satisfaction of a successful adventure!
