You search the warehouse level more thoroughly. Moving systematically through the space, you check behind crates, examine the walls for hidden panels, and study the floor for more trapdoors.

In what must have been the warehouse office—a small room with broken windows overlooking the main floor—you find something interesting: a safe, built into the wall. It's an old-fashioned iron safe with a combination lock.

The lock has three dials, each numbered 0-9. You'd need the combination to open it. But you notice the safe door is slightly warped, perhaps from age or an old fire. With enough force, it might break open.

You also find a ledger book on the remains of a desk. Flipping through it, you see shipping records from the 1840s. One entry catches your eye: "Special cargo for Captain I. - Combination: his founding year."

His founding year? You remember from the library—Captain Ironhook started his pirate career in 1822. Could that be the combination: 1-8-2-2?

What do you do?

* If you try to break the safe open by force, turn to [page 67](./67.md).
