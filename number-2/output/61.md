You follow the 7C tunnel or investigate the deeper areas, depending on which path brought you here. The tunnel descends sharply, becoming narrower and more treacherous. You're now very deep in the mountain—probably 500 feet or more below the surface.

The air is stale and difficult to breathe. You're about to turn back when the tunnel opens into a massive natural cavern. Your flashlight beam can barely reach the far walls.

The cavern floor is scattered with mining equipment from different eras—evidence that miners worked this area for over a century. And in the center, you see it: a raised stone platform with something sitting on top.

You approach carefully. On the platform: a chest, but it's been opened. Empty. Disappointment floods through you—someone beat you to it!

But wait. Next to the chest is a journal. You pick it up and read the first page: "To the seeker who finds this: the treasure was moved in 1923. Follow the water to find the new location."

Follow the water? You hear it then—the sound of an underground stream. You follow the sound to the far side of the cavern and find a passage following the water.
