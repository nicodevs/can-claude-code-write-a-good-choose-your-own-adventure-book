You pocket the gold coins carefully—they're surprisingly heavy, each one a substantial weight of precious metal. You count them: twenty-three coins total, all dating from the 1840s or earlier.

You climb back down from the cave, retrieve your kayak, and return to Harbortown. That evening, in your hotel room, you research the coins online. Each one is worth hundreds of dollars to collectors—together, they're worth about fifteen thousand dollars!

Not the legendary fortune you were hoping for, but nothing to sneeze at. You take the coins to a reputable dealer who authenticates them and makes you a fair offer. You accept.

With the money, you fund a college savings account, buy some equipment you've been wanting, and donate some to the historical society. You keep one coin as a memento—a reminder of your adventure.

The Ironhook legend says there's more treasure out there, hidden deeper in the mountains. Maybe someday you'll return to search for it. But for now, you're content with what you found.

Sometimes the journey is just as valuable as the destination.

**THE END**

You made a practical decision and came away with real treasure! Not every adventure ends with the ultimate prize, but you gained wealth, experience, and memories. Congratulations!
