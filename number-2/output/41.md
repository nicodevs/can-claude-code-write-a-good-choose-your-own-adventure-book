You continue down the right tunnel, deeper into the mountain. The air grows colder and damper. Your flashlight beam catches occasional glints of mineral deposits in the rock walls—maybe iron pyrite, fool's gold.

The tunnel levels out and you enter a larger area where multiple passages converge. It's like an underground crossroads. Old wooden signs hang from nails in the support beams, but most are too faded to read.

However, one sign is clearer than the others, as if it was painted more recently: "7B - straight ahead. Danger: flooding risk."

Flooding? You listen carefully and hear it—the distant sound of water. Not just dripping, but flowing, like an underground stream.

You press forward. The tunnel ahead shows water damage—erosion on the floor, watermarks on the walls. You round a bend and find your path blocked by a pool of dark water, stretching from wall to wall. The tunnel continues on the other side, visible in your flashlight beam, but you'd have to wade or swim through about twenty feet of water.

What do you do?

* If you wade through the water, turn to [page 60](./60.md).
* If you search for an alternate route, turn to [page 61](./61.md).
