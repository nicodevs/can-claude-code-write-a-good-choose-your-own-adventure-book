You pull the kayak up to the ledge and tie it to one of the iron rings. The ledge is about six feet wide, carved out of the natural cave wall. This definitely looks like it was used by smugglers—you can see where they cut the stone to create a flat surface.

You climb out of the kayak onto the ledge. At the back, you find a narrow opening, barely visible behind a curtain of dripping water. It looks like a passage leading deeper into the cliff.

You squeeze through the opening and find yourself in a dry chamber. Your flashlight reveals something incredible: stacked wooden crates, barrels, and in the corner—a large iron-bound chest with brass fittings. The chest has Captain Ironhook's symbol carved into the lid: a hook crossed with an anchor.

This is it! But the chest is locked with a massive padlock, corroded but still functional.

You search the chamber and find two options: a rusty crowbar leaning against the wall, or a small leather pouch hanging from a nail, which might contain something useful.

What do you do?

* If you use the crowbar to break the lock, turn to [page 66](./66.md).
* If you check the leather pouch first, turn to [page 67](./67.md).
