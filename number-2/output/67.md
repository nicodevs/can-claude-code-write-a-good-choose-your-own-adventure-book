You check the leather pouch (or try to force the safe, or climb toward the light—depending on your path). Inside the pouch, you find something unexpected: a folded piece of parchment, old and fragile.

You unfold it carefully. It's a map—but not the same as your grandmother's map. This one shows additional details, secret passages, and what looks like multiple treasure locations!

This is Captain Ironhook's master map, showing all his hidden caches. The main treasure you've been seeking is marked clearly, but there are also notations for smaller caches scattered across three states.

Following this new map, you navigate to the main treasure location with precision. You find it exactly where marked: a vault room filled with wealth beyond imagination. Gold, jewels, artifacts, and historical documents worth fortunes.

But more than that, you have the master map. This ensures you can find all of Ironhook's hidden treasures, not just one cache. You've won the ultimate prize.

**THE END**

You've discovered the master map! Your curiosity and thoroughness have given you not just one treasure, but the key to finding them all. Congratulations on your extraordinary success!
