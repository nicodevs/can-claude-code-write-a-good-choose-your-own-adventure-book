You settle at a computer terminal and begin searching the historical database. Your fingers fly across the keyboard: "Captain Ironhook, 1847, treasure."

The screen fills with results. You click through old newspaper scans, their text faded but readable. One headline catches your eye: "MYSTERIOUS PIRATE'S FORTUNE NEVER RECOVERED." The article describes how Captain Ironhook supposedly hid his plunder before his ship sank.

You find two promising leads: One article mentions coastal caves known as "Smuggler's Hollow" where contraband was once hidden. Another reference points to an old mining town in the mountains called Pinewood, where Ironhook allegedly had connections.

You print out the articles and study them carefully. Both locations match markings on your map.

Which lead do you follow?

* If you investigate the coastal caves at Smuggler's Hollow, turn to [page 14](./14.md).
* If you head to the old mining records at City Hall, turn to [page 15](./15.md).
