The cave with the star symbol is different immediately—it's clearly man-made, the walls showing chisel marks. You proceed cautiously, your flashlight revealing a passage that slopes downward.

After thirty feet, you enter a chamber. And stop dead.

The room is full of treasure.

Or rather, it was. Broken chests lie scattered, their lids torn off. A few gold coins are scattered on the floor, but the overwhelming evidence suggests this cache was looted long ago. You find remnants: rotted cloth, broken pottery, a single pearl necklace tangled in the debris.

On the wall, scratched by knife or nail, a message: "IRONHOOK'S DECOY - 1852."

This was a false cache! But it's five years after the treasure was supposedly hidden. Did someone find it and leave this message? Or did Ironhook create a decoy to throw off pursuers?

You search more carefully and find something the previous looters missed: a brass compass embedded in the cave floor, its needle pointing stubbornly inland, toward the mountains.

Do you:

* Follow the compass direction toward the mountains, turn to [page 58](./58.md).
* Collect the remaining coins and call it a success, turn to [page 59](./59.md).
