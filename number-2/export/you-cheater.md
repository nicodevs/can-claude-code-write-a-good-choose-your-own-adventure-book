⏺ Here are the accurate results for pages linked by multiple pages:

  Most connected pages:
  - ./60.md: 8 incoming links - from pages 30, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 53
  - ./61.md: 7 incoming links
  - ./65.md: 5 incoming links

  3 incoming links:
  - ./66.md
  - ./67.md
  - ./64.md
  - ./50.md

  2 incoming links:
  - ./48.md, ./49.md, ./51.md, ./52.md, ./56.md

  So page 60 is the most connected convergence point in the story, followed by pages 61 and 65. Page 66 actually has relatively
  modest connectivity compared to these other pages.
