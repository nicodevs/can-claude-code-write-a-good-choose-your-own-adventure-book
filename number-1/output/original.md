# STATION OSIRIS
## A Choose Your Own Adventure in Space

**Instructions**: Start at Section 1. At the end of each section, you'll be given choices. Pick one and turn to that section number. Your decisions will determine your fate aboard Station Osiris!

---

### Section 1

You wake up to the sound of an alarm blaring through your quarters. The red emergency lights pulse across the ceiling of your small cabin aboard Station Osiris, a deep-space research facility orbiting a distant moon. You're Alex Chen, a 19-year-old engineering apprentice who arrived at the station only three weeks ago.

Your tablet buzzes with an urgent message: "ALL PERSONNEL REPORT TO STATIONS. COMMUNICATIONS ARRAY MALFUNCTION."

Something feels wrong. In your short time here, you've never heard this alarm before. You swing your legs out of bed and quickly pull on your station jumpsuit.

Through your small window, you can see the swirling purple and blue gases of the Kepler Nebula. The station's lights reflect off your window, but you notice something odd—some sections of the station appear dark.

**What do you do?**
- Report immediately to the engineering bay as instructed → Go to Section 2
- Check on your roommate, Jamie, first → Go to Section 5
- Try to access the station's computer network for more information → Go to Section 8

---

### Section 2

You rush down the corridor toward the engineering bay, your magnetic boots clicking against the metal floor. The hallway is nearly empty—strange for a station-wide emergency. You pass by the observation deck and notice the stars seem dimmer than usual.

When you reach the engineering bay, you find Chief Engineer Torres frantically typing at a console. She's a stern woman in her fifties who rarely shows emotion, but right now, her face is pale with worry.

"Chen! Thank goodness. We've lost contact with the communications array, and half our systems are experiencing power fluctuations." She gestures to a screen showing a schematic of the station. Several sections are highlighted in red. "I need you to physically check the junction boxes in Sector 7. Take a toolkit and report back what you find."

Before you can respond, the lights flicker and dim to emergency power. In the reduced light, you notice something on one of Torres's screens—what looks like a ship's signature on the long-range scanners. But she closes that window quickly.

**What do you do?**
- Follow Torres's orders and head to Sector 7 → Go to Section 12
- Ask Torres about the ship signature you saw → Go to Section 15
- Suggest checking the main power core first → Go to Section 18

---

### Section 3

The ventilation shaft is cramped and dark. You pull yourself through the narrow space, your flashlight cutting through the shadows. The metal walls are cold, and you can hear the hum of the station's life support systems all around you.

After several minutes of crawling, you emerge into a storage area you've never seen before. It's not on any of the station maps you've studied. The room is filled with sealed containers, each marked with a symbol you don't recognize—a triangle within a circle.

Your heart races. What is this place?

You approach one of the containers and notice it's slightly warm to the touch. A small display panel on the side shows a readout in a language you don't understand, but the numbers are counting down.

Suddenly, you hear voices approaching from a corridor beyond the storage area.

**What do you do?**
- Hide and listen to the voices → Go to Section 25
- Open one of the containers to see what's inside → Go to Section 28
- Quickly return through the ventilation shaft → Go to Section 31

---

### Section 4

The security office is located near the station's main hub. You've only been inside once before, during your orientation. As you approach, you notice the door is slightly ajar, which is unusual—security doors are always sealed.

You push it open cautiously. "Hello?"

The office is dark except for the glow of multiple monitors. Security Chief Ramos sits at his desk, but he doesn't turn around when you enter. His attention is fixed on one particular screen.

"Chief Ramos?" you say, stepping closer.

He finally looks at you, and you're startled by the expression on his face—a mixture of fear and determination. "Alex. You shouldn't be here." He glances back at the screen. "But maybe... maybe you can help. I've been watching the security feeds. There are people aboard this station who aren't in the official crew manifest."

He pulls up footage from earlier today. You see figures in unmarked suits moving through restricted areas of the station.

"I don't know who they are or what they want," Ramos continues, "but they've been here for at least a week, hiding in the maintenance levels. And I think they're planning something."

**What do you do?**
- Ask to see more of the security footage → Go to Section 20
- Suggest alerting Captain Okafor immediately → Go to Section 23
- Question how they could have boarded without being detected → Go to Section 35

---

### Section 5

You knock on Jamie's door, but there's no response. Your roommate is a botanist who works in the hydroponics bay, and they're usually an early riser. You try the door and find it unlocked.

"Jamie?" You step inside. The room is empty, but Jamie's tablet is on the bed, still powered on. That's odd—Jamie never goes anywhere without it.

You glance at the screen and see an open message:

*"Meeting at 0600. Lab 3. Come alone. Don't tell anyone. -M"*

The timestamp shows the message was sent an hour ago. Lab 3 is in the research wing, a section you've never had clearance to visit. The emergency alarm is still echoing through the station, but this message seems important.

You notice Jamie's station ID badge on the desk—they definitely left in a hurry.

**What do you do?**
- Head to Lab 3 to look for Jamie → Go to Section 10
- Take Jamie's tablet to Chief Engineer Torres → Go to Section 14
- Report to your station as ordered and deal with this later → Go to Section 2

---

### Section 6

The medical bay is quiet when you arrive. Dr. Yuki, the station's physician, is preparing medical supplies and organizing equipment with practiced efficiency. She's a kind woman in her thirties who always has a calming presence.

"Alex," she says, looking up. "Are you hurt?"

"No, I just... something feels wrong about this emergency. Have you treated anyone unusual today?"

Dr. Yuki hesitates, then gestures for you to come closer. She lowers her voice. "I did have a patient this morning. A crew member I didn't recognize claimed they felt dizzy. But when I scanned them, their biometric data didn't match anyone in the station database."

She pulls up a file on her medical tablet. "I reported it to security, but Chief Ramos told me to keep it quiet for now. The patient left before I could ask more questions."

The lights flicker again, and you both glance up at the ceiling.

"There's something else," Dr. Yuki continues. "I've been monitoring the crew's health data remotely. Several people are showing elevated stress hormones and irregular sleep patterns over the past week—as if they're being influenced by something."

**What do you do?**
- Ask to see the health data patterns → Go to Section 32
- Head to security to talk to Chief Ramos → Go to Section 4
- Suggest this might be related to the communications malfunction → Go to Section 38

---

### Section 7

The mess hall is surprisingly crowded. Small groups of crew members huddle around tables, speaking in low voices. The usual morning chatter is replaced by an anxious murmur. You grab a nutrition pack and scan the room.

You spot Lieutenant Maria Santos, the station's head of operations, sitting alone in the corner. She catches your eye and waves you over. Maria has always been friendly to you since you arrived, often checking in on how you're adjusting to station life.

"Sit down, Alex," she says quietly. "We need to talk. I've been trying to figure out what's really going on, and I think I'm close to the truth."

She slides a small data chip across the table. "I pulled some files from the restricted database before the systems went haywire. This contains information about the station's real mission—and it's not what they told us during orientation."

She glances around nervously. "I don't know who I can trust anymore. But you're new enough that you're not caught up in whatever conspiracy is happening here. Take this chip. If something happens to me, find out what's on it."

Before you can respond, the lights cut out completely, plunging the mess hall into darkness. Emergency lights kick in after a few seconds, but Lieutenant Santos is already standing, her hand on her sidearm.

"Stay alert," she whispers.

**What do you do?**
- Pocket the data chip and stick with Lieutenant Santos → Go to Section 40
- Ask what's on the chip immediately → Go to Section 43
- Suggest heading to the command center together → Go to Section 46

---

### Section 8

You sit at your desk terminal and enter your access code. The screen flickers to life, showing the station's network interface. Most systems are running normally, but you notice several blocked access warnings.

You try to pull up the communications array diagnostics, but you're denied. Your clearance isn't high enough. However, you remember a trick another engineer showed you—a backdoor in the maintenance logs that sometimes reveals system information.

After a few minutes of searching, you find something interesting. The communications array didn't malfunction—it was deliberately shut down from a terminal in Lab 3, using Captain Okafor's access codes. The shutdown happened at 0545 hours, just minutes before the alarm sounded.

But that doesn't make sense. Why would the captain cut communications and then trigger an alarm?

You dig deeper and discover another anomaly: the station's external sensors detected an approaching vessel three days ago, but the record was deleted from the main database. You're only seeing it now because a backup copy exists in the raw sensor logs.

Someone is trying to hide something.

**What do you do?**
- Report this information to Chief Engineer Torres → Go to Section 16
- Go to Lab 3 to investigate personally → Go to Section 10
- Try to contact Captain Okafor directly → Go to Section 48

---

### Section 9

The hydroponics bay is a vast chamber filled with rows of plants growing under artificial sunlight. The air is humid and smells like earth and growing things—a welcome change from the recycled air in the rest of the station. This is where the station grows its fresh food.

You walk between the rows, calling out for Jamie. The usual hum of the water systems and grow lights is soothing, but something feels off. Some of the plants look wilted, as if they haven't been tended to in days.

Near the back of the bay, you find one of the growing stations torn apart, soil scattered across the floor. It looks like someone was searching for something hidden among the plants.

Then you see it—a small metallic device buried partially in the soil. It's about the size of your fist, with blinking lights and an antenna. You've never seen anything like it in any engineering manual.

As you reach for it, you hear a noise behind you. Someone's entering the hydroponics bay.

**What do you do?**
- Hide and observe who's coming → Go to Section 50
- Grab the device and confront whoever's entering → Go to Section 53
- Leave the device and act like you're just checking the plants → Go to Section 56

---

### Section 10

Lab 3 is located in the restricted research wing. You've walked past this section before but never had clearance to enter. When you arrive, you're surprised to find the security panel disabled and the door slightly open.

You push it open carefully and step inside. The lab is larger than you expected, filled with advanced equipment you don't recognize. In the center of the room is a large cylindrical chamber containing what looks like a rock sample—but it's glowing with a faint blue light.

Three people in lab coats are gathered around a computer console. One of them is Dr. Hassan, the station's lead xenobiologist. The other two you don't recognize.

Dr. Hassan looks up as you enter. "Alex? What are you doing here? This area is restricted." His voice is stern, but you detect a hint of nervousness.

Before you can answer, one of the other scientists speaks up: "Let them stay, Hassan. If they're here, they've probably already noticed something is wrong. We might need all the help we can get."

She turns to you. "I'm Dr. Amelia Park. That sample in the chamber—we found it on the moon's surface two months ago. It's not a rock. It's alive. And it's been communicating."

**What do you do?**
- Ask what the sample has been communicating → Go to Section 58
- Question why this was kept secret from the crew → Go to Section 61
- Ask if this is connected to the current emergency → Go to Section 64

---

### Section 11

The command center is the brain of Station Osiris, located at the hub where all the modules connect. When you arrive, you find Captain Okafor standing at the main display with her first officer, Commander Zhang.

Captain Okafor is a tall woman with short gray hair and a commanding presence. She's been a space officer for thirty years, and her experience shows in the calm way she's assessing the situation despite the emergency.

"Chen," she acknowledges you with a nod. "Did Torres send you?"

"Not exactly, Captain. I came because—"

"Save it," Commander Zhang interrupts. He's a stocky man with a perpetual frown. "We have bigger problems. The communications array is down, and we've detected an unidentified ship approaching. It'll be within docking range in two hours."

Captain Okafor shoots Zhang a warning look. "That information is classified, Commander."

"With respect, Captain, the crew deserves to know what's coming."

The tension between them is palpable. You realize there's disagreement about how to handle the situation.

Captain Okafor turns to you. "Alex, since you're here, I need someone I can trust. I'm going to send you on an assignment, but I need to know: will you follow my orders without question?"

**What do you do?**
- Agree to follow the Captain's orders → Go to Section 67
- Ask what the assignment is before committing → Go to Section 70
- Side with Commander Zhang and ask about the approaching ship → Go to Section 73

---

### Section 12

Sector 7 is in the older part of the station, where the original modules were constructed. The corridors here are narrower, and you can hear the creaks and groans of the station's structure more clearly.

You follow the maintenance route on your tablet, toolkit in hand. The junction boxes are located in a service corridor that runs parallel to the main habitat ring.

When you arrive, you immediately see the problem. One of the junction boxes is open, and several power conduits have been deliberately disconnected—this wasn't a malfunction. Someone sabotaged it.

You're about to report this when you notice something else: fresh boot prints in the dust on the floor, leading deeper into the service corridor. Someone was here recently.

Against your better judgment, you follow the prints. They lead to a sealed hatch marked "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY." The hatch is slightly ajar.

You can hear voices on the other side.

**What do you do?**
- Listen to the voices before deciding what to do → Go to Section 76
- Report the sabotage to Chief Torres immediately → Go to Section 79
- Open the hatch and confront whoever is inside → Go to Section 82

---

### Section 13

The escape pods are located in three clusters around the station. You head to the nearest one, located near your quarters. Your heart is pounding. Should you really be thinking about escape when others might need help?

When you reach the escape pod bay, you find Security Chief Ramos already there, checking the pods' systems. He looks up, startled to see you.

"Alex. What are you doing here?"

You hesitate, embarrassed. "I... I was just checking if they're operational. In case of emergency."

Ramos studies you for a moment, then nods. "Smart thinking. But I have bad news—someone has disabled the launch mechanisms on all the pods in this section. They're locked down tight."

He shows you his tablet. "Same story in the other pod bays. Someone doesn't want anyone leaving this station."

A chill runs down your spine. "Why would someone do that?"

"I have a theory," Ramos says grimly. "But I need to confirm something first. Come with me. I could use someone I can trust."

**What do you do?**
- Follow Ramos to investigate his theory → Go to Section 85
- Suggest you try to repair one of the escape pods → Go to Section 88
- Ask Ramos to share his theory first → Go to Section 91

---

### Section 14

You grab Jamie's tablet and head toward the engineering bay, where you know Chief Torres will be. The tablet feels heavy in your hands—like you're carrying a secret that might change everything.

As you walk, you can't resist taking another look at the message: "Meeting at 0600. Lab 3. Come alone. Don't tell anyone. -M"

Who is "M"? And why would Jamie go to a secret meeting during a station emergency?

You arrive at the engineering bay, but Torres isn't there. Instead, you find Ensign Marcus Webb, a young systems analyst who seems perpetually stressed. He's frantically trying to reroute power from one system to another.

"Webb, where's Chief Torres?"

"She left five minutes ago. Said she had to check something in the cargo bay. Asked me to hold down the fort." He looks overwhelmed. "I don't suppose you know how to recalibrate a plasma distributor?"

You're about to answer when Jamie's tablet buzzes in your hand. A new message:

*"Where are you? We're waiting. This is important. -M"*

**What do you do?**
- Help Webb with the engineering tasks → Go to Section 94
- Go to the cargo bay to find Torres → Go to Section 97
- Respond to the message on Jamie's tablet → Go to Section 100

---

### Section 15

"Chief Torres," you say carefully, "I saw something on your screen. A ship signature. Is there a vessel approaching the station?"

Torres's jaw tightens. She's quiet for a long moment, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. Finally, she turns to face you fully.

"What I'm about to tell you is classified, but given the situation, I think you need to know." She pulls up the long-range scanner data. "That ship has been approaching for the last three days. It's not responding to our hails, and its transponder is off. We don't know who they are or what they want."

"Does Captain Okafor know?"

"Of course. She's been coordinating with Earth Command, but..." Torres hesitates. "The communications array went down before we received their last transmission. We're on our own now."

She studies you intently. "I'm telling you this because I need someone in engineering I can trust. There are people on this station who might not have our best interests at heart. Whatever happens in the next few hours, I need you to stay alert and report anything unusual directly to me. Understood?"

Before you can respond, an explosion rocks the station. You grab onto the console to steady yourself.

"That came from the docking section!" Torres shouts. "Someone's trying to breach the airlock!"

**What do you do?**
- Rush to the docking section with Torres → Go to Section 103
- Suggest sealing the affected section to prevent decompression → Go to Section 106
- Recommend checking if it was an internal explosion → Go to Section 109

---

### Section 16

You grab your tablet and hurry to the engineering bay. Chief Torres is exactly where you left her, still working frantically at her console. When you show her what you found in the system logs, her expression darkens.

"Captain Okafor's access codes," she mutters, reading through the data. "But I saw the Captain fifteen minutes ago in the command center. She couldn't have been in Lab 3 at the time of the shutdown."

"So someone used her codes?"

"Or there's a duplicate command authorization in the system." Torres pulls up a new screen, her fingers flying across the keyboard. "This is worse than I thought. Someone's been planning this for weeks."

She finds something else: a hidden subroutine in the station's core systems, set to activate when the unknown ship enters docking range.

"We need to shut this down now," Torres says, "but I'll need direct access to the primary server core. It's in the lower tech level—three decks down. I can't leave engineering right now, not with the power fluctuations."

She looks at you seriously. "I need you to go to the server core and manually disable this subroutine. Here's the access code." She transfers the information to your tablet. "Be careful, Alex. Whoever set this up won't want you interfering."

**What do you do?**
- Head to the server core alone → Go to Section 112
- Ask Torres if there's anyone else you can bring for backup → Go to Section 115
- Suggest reporting this to Captain Okafor first → Go to Section 118

---

### Section 17

The cargo bay is massive, filled with supply containers and equipment. The space is dimly lit, with only the emergency lights providing illumination. The bay is designed to dock supply ships and store several months' worth of materials.

You call out as you enter. "Hello? Is anyone here?"

Your voice echoes in the vast space. You walk carefully between the rows of containers, your footsteps ringing on the metal floor.

Then you hear it—a scraping sound coming from the far end of the bay. You move toward it cautiously, your hand reaching for the emergency communicator on your belt.

Behind a stack of containers marked "SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT," you find Chief Torres and two crew members you don't recognize. They're loading equipment onto a small transport cart, working quickly and quietly.

Torres sees you and freezes. "Alex. I... this isn't what it looks like."

One of the other crew members—a tall man with a scar across his cheek—steps forward. "Torres, I thought you said no one would come down here."

"I didn't expect—" Torres starts, but you interrupt.

"What's going on? What are you doing?"

Torres looks torn, then makes a decision. "Get over here, quickly. We don't have much time, and I need to explain something before they find us."

**What do you do?**
- Approach Torres to hear her explanation → Go to Section 121
- Back away and call for security → Go to Section 124
- Demand answers before moving closer → Go to Section 127

---

### Section 18

"Chief Torres," you say, "shouldn't we check the main power core first? If we're having power fluctuations across multiple systems, the problem might be centralized there."

Torres considers this for a moment, then nods slowly. "Good thinking, Chen. The power core would affect multiple systems simultaneously. And if something's wrong there, checking junction boxes won't tell us anything useful."

She closes the windows on her console and grabs her own toolkit. "Come with me. The main power core is in the central hub. If we're going to investigate, I want you there. Your engineering scores were the highest in your academy class—I checked your file when you came aboard."

You follow Torres through the corridors toward the central hub. As you walk, she speaks quietly. "Alex, there's something you should know. This isn't just a technical malfunction. Someone has been making unauthorized modifications to our systems over the past two weeks. Small changes, easy to miss unless you know what to look for. I've been documenting everything, but I haven't figured out the pattern yet."

"Do you know who's behind it?"

"I have suspicions. But no proof." She glances at you. "Watch yourself. Trust is a luxury we might not have right now."

You reach the power core chamber. The door is sealed with a security lock.

**What do you do?**
- Use Torres's access code to open the door → Go to Section 130
- Check the security logs to see who entered recently → Go to Section 133
- Scan for energy signatures before entering → Go to Section 136

---

### Section 19

The observation deck offers a stunning view of the Kepler Nebula and the moon below. Usually, it's a peaceful place where crew members come to relax and contemplate the beauty of space. But today, the deck is empty and eerily quiet.

You walk to the large viewport and look out at the stars. For a moment, you forget about the emergency and just appreciate the view. Out here, billions of kilometers from Earth, you're reminded of how small and fragile humanity really is.

Then you notice something that makes your breath catch.

There, against the backdrop of stars, is a ship. It's still far away, but it's definitely approaching the station. The vessel is larger than a typical supply ship, and its design is unfamiliar—sleek and angular, with no visible markings.

You're about to reach for your communicator when you hear someone else enter the observation deck.

It's Dr. Hassan, the xenobiologist. He's carrying a data pad and seems surprised to see you here.

"Alex," he says carefully. "Enjoying the view?"

"There's a ship out there," you say, pointing. "Do you see it?"

Dr. Hassan moves to stand beside you at the viewport. He's quiet for a long moment, then speaks. "Yes. I see it. That's why I came here—to watch its approach." He turns to you. "What I'm about to tell you will sound unbelievable. But I need you to listen and decide for yourself what the truth is."

**What do you do?**
- Listen to Dr. Hassan's explanation → Go to Section 139
- Ask if the approaching ship is hostile → Go to Section 142
- Question why he's here alone instead of at his station → Go to Section 145

---

### Section 20

"Show me more of the footage," you say, pulling up a chair next to Security Chief Ramos.

He nods and begins pulling up different camera feeds. Over the next several minutes, you watch as figures in unmarked suits move through the maintenance levels, the cargo bays, and even some of the laboratories. They're careful, avoiding cameras when possible, but Ramos has been thorough in his surveillance.

"I count at least six intruders," Ramos says, "maybe more. They seem to know the station's layout—they're moving too confidently to be unfamiliar with the structure."

"Could they have been here before? During construction?"

"Possible. Or they had detailed schematics." He pulls up another feed. "This is from yesterday. Watch closely."

You see one of the intruders enter Lab 3 and interact with Dr. Hassan. The conversation appears friendly—there's no struggle or confrontation. They shake hands, and the intruder passes Hassan a small container.

"Dr. Hassan is working with them?" you whisper.

"It would appear so. But I don't know who else might be involved." Ramos turns to face you. "That's why I haven't reported this to Captain Okafor yet. I don't know who I can trust. But you—you're new, unconnected to whatever's been happening. I need your help to figure this out."

He hands you a small earpiece. "This is a secure communicator. Keep it with you. If you discover anything, contact me immediately. We need to find out what they're planning before it's too late."

**What do you do?**
- Accept the communicator and offer to investigate Dr. Hassan → Go to Section 148
- Suggest confronting Dr. Hassan directly together → Go to Section 10
- Recommend bringing this to Captain Okafor despite the risks → Go to Section 23

---

### Section 21

*[This section will continue the story with new branching paths]*

You decide to investigate the strange readings on your own. Sometimes the best way to understand a problem is to see it firsthand, without the complications that come from involving others who might have their own agendas.

You grab your personal toolkit and a portable scanner, then head toward the section of the station where the anomalous readings originated. According to the data you pulled from the system, there's an unusual energy signature coming from a maintenance tunnel that shouldn't have any active systems.

The tunnel is cramped and poorly lit. You have to duck to avoid hitting your head on the low ceiling. The scanner in your hand chirps softly, showing the energy signature getting stronger as you progress deeper.

After about fifty meters, you find the source: a device about the size of a briefcase, attached to one of the station's main data conduits. It's not standard station equipment—the design is too sleek, too advanced.

As you examine it, you realize what it is: some kind of monitoring system, designed to intercept and copy data flowing through the station's network. Someone has been spying on all station communications.

You're about to disconnect it when you hear voices behind you. Someone is coming through the tunnel.

**What do you do?**
- Disconnect the device and hide it in your toolkit → Go to Section 151
- Leave the device but hide yourself to see who's coming → Go to Section 25
- Disconnect the device and confront whoever's approaching → Go to Section 154

---

### Section 22

*[This section will continue the story with new branching paths]*

You decide the best course of action is to gather your own evidence before making any accusations. If there really is a conspiracy, you need concrete proof before you can convince anyone in authority to take action.

Over the next hour, you methodically work through the station's systems, using your engineering access to check logs, scan for anomalies, and cross-reference crew schedules with system access times. What you discover is disturbing.

Multiple crew members have been accessing systems outside their normal duties: Dr. Hassan in the weapons locker, Lieutenant Santos in the navigation controls, even Dr. Yuki accessed the cargo manifest three times in one night. The pattern suggests coordination—everyone playing a specific role in something larger.

But one name appears more often than any other: Commander Zhang. The first officer has been accessing nearly every system on the station, often during the night shift when most crew are sleeping.

You save all the evidence to a secure partition on your tablet, encrypting it with your personal code. This is explosive information—if you're right, there's a conspiracy involving some of the station's highest-ranking officers.

As you're finishing up, your tablet buzzes with a message from Chief Torres: "Where are you? Need you in engineering ASAP. -Torres"

**What do you do?**
- Report to engineering as Torres requested → Go to Section 2
- Go to Captain Okafor with the evidence you've gathered → Go to Section 11
- Continue investigating to find out what they're all planning → Go to Section 157

---

### Section 23

"Chief Ramos," you say firmly, "we need to alert Captain Okafor immediately. She needs to know there are unauthorized personnel on the station."

Ramos considers this, stroking his chin thoughtfully. "You might be right. The Captain has the authority to initiate security protocols that I can't activate on my own. And if there's going to be a confrontation, I want her in command."

He taps his communicator. "Ramos to Captain Okafor. We have a Code 7 situation. Request immediate meeting in your ready room."

There's a pause, then the Captain's voice comes through, calm but authoritative: "Acknowledged, Chief. On my way. Bring whoever's with you."

Ten minutes later, you're standing in Captain Okafor's ready room, a small but well-appointed office adjacent to the command center. The Captain listens intently as Ramos shows her the security footage and explains what he's discovered.

When he's finished, Captain Okafor leans back in her chair, her expression unreadable. "This is troubling, Chief. Very troubling. You were right to bring this to me."

She stands and walks to the viewport, looking out at the stars. "However, I'm going to ask you both to do something difficult. I need you to continue monitoring the situation, but do not confront these intruders. Not yet."

"Captain?" Ramos sounds confused. "With respect, they're a threat to—"

"I understand your concern, Chief. But we don't know their full capabilities or their objectives. If we move too soon, we might trigger exactly the crisis we're trying to prevent." She turns back to you both. "Give me twelve hours to implement some... protective measures. Can you do that?"

**What do you do?**
- Trust Captain Okafor's judgment and wait → Go to Section 160
- Question why she wants to wait instead of acting now → Go to Section 163
- Privately doubt the Captain's motives → Go to Section 166

### Section 24

*[This section will continue with another branch of the story]*

**What do you do?**
- [Branch options will be added as the story continues]

---

### Section 25

You quickly find a dark corner behind some equipment and crouch down, barely breathing. Two figures emerge from the shadows, their faces obscured by the dim lighting. They're wearing standard station jumpsuits, but something about the way they move suggests military training.

"The device is still active," one of them says—a woman's voice. "No one's discovered it yet."

"Good. The longer we can monitor their communications, the better prepared we'll be when the Horizon arrives." The second voice is male, deeper.

The Horizon. That must be the name of the approaching ship.

"Are you sure Hassan won't crack?" the woman asks. "He seemed nervous during our last meeting."

"Hassan will hold. He knows what's at stake. Besides, he's too invested now to back out. Once they discover what that sample really is, he'll have nowhere to go but with us."

They're talking about Dr. Hassan and the sample in Lab 3. Your mind races, trying to piece together the connections.

The man continues: "Torres is the one I'm worried about. She's too smart for her own good. If she figures out what we've done to the power systems before we're ready—"

"Then we deal with her. Same as we dealt with Morrison."

Morrison? That was the previous chief engineer—the one who supposedly transferred off the station two weeks before you arrived.

The two figures check the device quickly, then begin to leave. As they pass your hiding spot, you hold your breath, praying they won't notice you in the shadows.

They pass by. You're safe.

**What do you do?**
- Follow them carefully to see where they go → Go to Section 169
- Report what you heard to Chief Torres immediately → Go to Section 16
- Try to examine the device they were checking → Go to Section 21

### Section 28

Your curiosity overcomes your caution. You need to know what's inside these containers. You approach the nearest one and search for a way to open it. There's a manual release handle—probably required by safety regulations.

You grip the handle and pull. There's a hiss of pressurized air escaping, and the container's lid slowly rises.

Inside, protected in a cushioned housing, is a weapon. Not just any weapon—this is military-grade hardware, far beyond what a research station should have. It's a pulse rifle, the kind used by Earth Defense Forces in combat situations.

You quickly check two more containers. Each one contains weapons, ammunition, or tactical gear. There must be enough equipment here to arm fifty people.

Why would a civilian research station have a hidden weapons cache?

The voices you heard earlier are getting closer. You seal the container you just opened, but there's no time to get back to the ventilation shaft. You're trapped.

Three people enter the storage area. You recognize one of them—Lieutenant Santos. The other two are crew members you've seen around but don't know personally.

Santos sees you immediately. Her hand moves to her sidearm, but she doesn't draw it. "Alex Chen. I didn't expect to find you here." Her voice is carefully neutral. "I suppose you have questions."

**What do you do?**
- Demand to know what this weapons cache is for → Go to Section 172
- Ask if you're in danger → Go to Section 175
- Pretend you didn't see anything and ask to leave → Go to Section 178

---

### Section 29

The recreation room is usually a lively space where crew members relax after their shifts, playing games, reading, or socializing. But when you enter, it's nearly deserted. Only one person is there: Ensign Marcus Webb from engineering, hunched over a chess board, playing against himself.

He looks up when you enter. "Alex. Couldn't sleep either?"

"Emergency alarm woke me up," you reply. "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at your station?"

Webb shrugs. "Torres sent me to get some rest. Said I was making mistakes because I was exhausted." He gestures to the empty chairs around him. "Want to help me think through a problem?"

You sit down, curious. Webb isn't the type to disobey orders, so if Torres sent him to rest, there must be a reason.

"It's not really about chess," Webb says quietly, moving a piece without looking at the board. "I found something in the engineering logs. Power draws that don't match any authorized systems. Someone's been siphoning energy from the main reactor for weeks, but covering their tracks really well."

He slides a data chip across the table. "I copied the evidence before Torres could see what I was doing. I don't know who to trust with this. Torres might be involved. Hell, anyone might be involved."

"Why are you telling me?"

"Because you're new. You haven't had time to get caught up in whatever's happening." He stands. "I'm going to disappear for a while. Hide. If something happens to me, make sure that data gets to Captain Okafor."

**What do you do?**
- Take the data chip and promise to protect it → Go to Section 181
- Ask Webb to stay and work together → Go to Section 184
- Refuse the chip and insist he report this himself → Go to Section 187

### Section 30

You make your way to the docking bay, the part of the station designed to receive supply ships and personnel transports. It's a large, pressurized area with multiple airlocks and docking ports. When you arrive, you find the bay sealed with security protocols—unusual for a routine emergency.

Through the reinforced window, you can see the exterior docking clamps moving on their own, as if preparing to receive a ship. But there's no scheduled arrival for another three weeks.

Someone is overriding the docking protocols remotely.

You hear footsteps behind you and turn to find Commander Zhang approaching, his expression grim. "Chen. This area is restricted."

"Commander, the docking clamps are active. Is someone arriving?"

Zhang studies you for a long moment, then seems to make a decision. "Come with me. Quickly."

He leads you to a small observation room overlooking the docking bay. Through the window, you can see space beyond, and there—growing larger by the minute—is the approaching ship. The Horizon.

"It'll be here in less than an hour," Zhang says quietly. "And when it arrives, everything changes."

"What do you mean? Who are they?"

"The people who can save us," Zhang replies. "Or destroy us, depending on how the next few hours play out." He faces you directly. "I need to know where you stand, Alex. When that ship docks, there's going to be a confrontation. Captain Okafor has made her choice. I've made mine. Now you need to make yours."

**What do you do?**
- Ask Commander Zhang to explain what's really happening → Go to Section 190
- Side with Zhang and offer to help him → Go to Section 193
- Refuse to choose and demand to speak with Captain Okafor → Go to Section 11

---

### Section 31

You quickly crawl back through the ventilation shaft, your heart pounding. Whatever is in that storage room, it's clearly something dangerous and secret. You need to report this to someone in authority, but who can you trust?

The shaft opens back into the corridor where you started. You drop down and start walking quickly toward the engineering bay, trying to organize your thoughts.

As you round a corner, you nearly collide with Jamie, your roommate. They look disheveled and frightened.

"Alex! Thank God. I've been looking for you." Jamie grabs your arm. "We need to talk. Somewhere private."

"What's wrong? I found your message about Lab 3—"

"Forget that. Everything's changed." Jamie glances around nervously, then pulls you into a nearby supply closet. In the cramped space, illuminated only by the emergency lighting seeping through the door crack, Jamie whispers urgently.

"That meeting I went to—it was a trap. They wanted to recruit me. There's a group planning to take over the station when the relief ship arrives. But it's not a relief ship, Alex. It's full of armed operatives."

"Who? Who's planning this?"

"I don't know all of them. Dr. Hassan is involved. Maybe others. They said I could either join them or..." Jamie's voice breaks. "They threatened to make it look like an accident if I refused. I told them I'd think about it, but we need to do something."

**What do you do?**
- Take Jamie to Captain Okafor immediately → Go to Section 11
- Go to security and report the conspiracy to Chief Ramos → Go to Section 4
- Suggest you and Jamie gather evidence first before reporting → Go to Section 196

---

### Section 32

"Can I see those health data patterns?" you ask Dr. Yuki.

She nods and pulls up a series of graphs on her medical tablet. "Look at this. These are sleep patterns for twelve crew members over the past two weeks. See how they're all showing disruption at roughly the same times?"

You study the data. She's right—there's a clear pattern of disturbed sleep occurring between 0200 and 0400 hours for multiple crew members.

"And here," Dr. Yuki continues, swiping to another screen, "are the stress hormone levels. All elevated, but not from normal work stress. This is more like psychological manipulation or fear response."

"Could it be environmental? Something in the air or water?"

"I considered that. But the atmospheric processors show normal function, and water quality tests come back clean." She lowers her voice even further. "I think they're being influenced psychologically. Maybe through subliminal messages in the station's communication system, or directed sound waves. I've read about experimental technologies that can induce specific emotional states."

"That's... that's disturbing."

"It gets worse." Dr. Yuki shows you another file. "The crew members showing these symptoms? They're all people in key positions: engineering, security, communications, command. Someone is targeting the people who control the station."

Suddenly, the medical bay doors slide open. Dr. Hassan enters, looking surprised to see you there.

"Dr. Yuki," he says carefully. "I need to speak with you. Privately."

**What do you do?**
- Leave to give them privacy → Go to Section 199
- Stay and confront Dr. Hassan about what you know → Go to Section 10
- Pretend to leave but listen from outside → Go to Section 202

---

### Section 33

*[Continue from previous branches]*

You decide to trust your instincts and explore the lower engineering levels on your own. This section of the station is older, built during the initial construction phase, and rarely visited except for maintenance.

The corridors here are narrower, with exposed conduits and piping running along the walls. Your footsteps echo in the empty spaces. According to the station schematics, there shouldn't be anything down here except backup systems and storage.

But as you explore, you find something that shouldn't exist: a sealed door with no identification markings. It's not on any official blueprint you've studied.

You try your access card, but it's denied. This door requires higher clearance—likely command level or above.

You're about to leave when you notice the door is slightly warm to the touch. Something on the other side is generating heat—a lot of it.

Your engineering tablet has a thermal scanner. You activate it and point it at the door. The readings are surprising: there's a large active system on the other side, drawing significant power. But according to the official power distribution records, this section should be dormant.

Someone has built or activated an unauthorized system in the lower levels of the station.

**What do you do?**
- Try to override the door's security → Go to Section 205
- Report the unauthorized system to Chief Torres → Go to Section 2
- Look for another way into the room → Go to Section 208

---

### Section 34

*[Path continuation]*

You find yourself in the station's library—a small room filled with data terminals and a few physical books, a luxury on a space station. It's one of the quietest places aboard, rarely visited since most crew members access information digitally from their quarters.

But today, someone else is here. Captain Okafor sits at one of the reading terminals, reviewing something on the screen. She looks tired, older than her years, with the weight of command evident in her posture.

She notices you and gestures for you to approach. "Alex Chen. I've been hoping to speak with you."

"Captain?" You're surprised. Why would the station commander want to talk to a junior engineer?

"Sit down." It's not a request. You take the chair across from her. She closes the file she was reading—but not before you catch a glimpse of the header: "OPERATION LIGHTHOUSE - CLASSIFIED."

"You've been asking questions," Okafor says. "Looking into things. I've been monitoring the security logs. You've accessed files, talked to various crew members, investigated unusual occurrences." She holds up a hand before you can protest. "I'm not reprimanding you. In fact, I'm relieved. It shows initiative and intelligence."

She leans forward. "I'm going to tell you something that very few people on this station know. Station Osiris is not just a research facility. It's a listening post, designed to detect and analyze signals from deep space. Three months ago, we detected something. A transmission from a source that shouldn't exist."

"What kind of transmission?"

"One that suggests we're not alone in the universe. And that whoever sent it is coming here."

**What do you do?**
- Ask what the transmission said → Go to Section 211
- Question if the approaching ship is related → Go to Section 214
- Ask why she's telling you this → Go to Section 217

---

### Section 35

"Chief Ramos," you say, "how could these intruders have boarded the station without being detected? Don't we scan every ship that docks?"

Ramos nods grimly. "We do. Which means either they've been here longer than I thought—possibly hiding since construction—or someone with access to our security systems let them aboard and erased the records."

He pulls up another screen. "I went back through the docking logs for the past year. Three months ago, there was a supply ship that docked for routine maintenance and resupply. The manifest listed forty containers of equipment and supplies. But when I cross-referenced the delivery records, we only logged thirty-eight containers."

"Two containers disappeared?"

"Exactly. Large enough to hide several people in cryo-sleep or with minimal life support." He shows you the video footage from that day. "Watch this. The containers are offloaded here by the ship's crew. But during the process, there's a convenient camera malfunction for exactly eighteen minutes. When the cameras come back online, all the containers are in our cargo bay."

"So in those eighteen minutes, someone could have moved two containers somewhere else on the station."

"Right. And I think I know where." Ramos pulls up a station schematic. "The maintenance level below cargo storage. It's rarely inspected, has its own life support connection, and could easily hide a small group of people."

He looks at you seriously. "I need to investigate that area, but I can't do it alone. If I'm right about where they're hiding, confronting them could be dangerous. Will you come with me?"

**What do you do?**
- Agree to accompany Ramos to the maintenance level → Go to Section 220
- Suggest getting more backup first → Go to Section 223
- Recommend surveillance before confrontation → Go to Section 226

---

### Section 36

*[Additional path]*

The gym is empty when you arrive, which is unusual. Usually, there are a few crew members working out at any time of day. The equipment sits idle, and the space feels abandoned.

You're about to leave when you notice something odd: one of the wall panels is slightly askew. In a space station, everything is precision-fitted. A loose panel could indicate a structural problem—or someone tampering with the station's interior.

You approach the panel and carefully remove it. Behind it is a hollow space between the walls, and inside that space is equipment you don't recognize: sophisticated electronics with multiple cables running deeper into the wall structure.

As you examine it closer, you realize what you're looking at: a signal jammer. Someone has installed a device designed to block or interfere with communications. But it's currently inactive.

Your engineer's mind races through the implications. If this were activated, it could prevent sections of the station from communicating with each other—isolating crew members and preventing coordinated responses to emergencies.

You're taking images of the device with your tablet when you hear the gym door open. Someone's coming.

**What do you do?**
- Quickly replace the panel and pretend you're exercising → Go to Section 229
- Confront whoever's entering about the jammer → Go to Section 232
- Hide behind equipment to see who it is → Go to Section 235

---

### Section 37

*[Path branch]*

You make your way to the communications center, hoping to get a clearer picture of what's happening with the station's external communications. The center is a small, secure room filled with advanced transmission equipment, designed to maintain contact with Earth Command and coordinate with passing ships.

Communications Officer Petty Officer Lisa Park is on duty. She's young, maybe a year older than you, and always seems stressed about something.

When you enter, she jumps slightly. "Alex. You startled me. What do you need?"

"I was just wondering about the communications malfunction. Any progress on repairs?"

Lisa glances nervously at her screens, then at the door. "Can you close that?"

You shut the door, and Lisa immediately lowers her voice. "There is no malfunction. The array was deliberately shut down using command authorization codes. I reported it to Captain Okafor, and she ordered me to tell everyone it was a technical failure."

"Why would she do that?"

"I don't know. But there's more." Lisa pulls up a log file. "Before the array was shut down, I received a partial transmission from Earth Command. It was marked urgent, eyes-only for the Captain. The transmission was cut off mid-message, but I saved the fragment."

She plays it for you. A stern-faced admiral appears on the screen: "...cannot allow the sample to fall into their hands. If necessary, implement Protocol Omega and—" The transmission ends abruptly.

"Protocol Omega?" you ask. "What's that?"

"I don't know. It's not in any standard operations manual. But whatever it is, it scared the Captain enough that she cut our communications with Earth."

**What do you do?**
- Ask Lisa to help you research Protocol Omega → Go to Section 238
- Report this to Security Chief Ramos → Go to Section 4
- Confront Captain Okafor about the transmission → Go to Section 11

---

### Section 38

"Dr. Yuki," you say, "could these health anomalies be connected to the communications malfunction? Maybe they're both symptoms of the same problem?"

Dr. Yuki considers this thoughtfully. "It's possible. If there's some kind of interference affecting our systems, it could also affect biological functions. The human brain does operate on electrical impulses."

She pulls up a new screen. "Let me check something." Her fingers fly across the interface, pulling up sensor readings from throughout the station. "Look at this. There are low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuations occurring throughout the station, originating from... " She pauses, her eyes widening. "From Lab 3."

"The research lab?"

"Yes. And the pattern of fluctuations matches the timing of the crew's sleep disruptions." She looks at you with growing concern. "Whatever they're studying in Lab 3, it's emitting some kind of field that's affecting everyone on the station. We need to shut it down."

Before you can respond, the medical bay's emergency alarm activates. Dr. Yuki's computer shows an incoming casualty.

"Medical emergency in Sector 9," she says, already grabbing her medical kit. "Someone's been injured. I have to go."

She pauses at the door. "Alex, if you investigate Lab 3, be careful. If I'm right about the electromagnetic field, direct exposure could be dangerous."

**What do you do?**
- Help Dr. Yuki with the medical emergency → Go to Section 241
- Go immediately to Lab 3 to investigate → Go to Section 10
- First report your findings to Chief Torres → Go to Section 2

---

### Section 39

*[Branch path]*

You head toward the waste management section—not a glamorous destination, but crucial to the station's operation. The area is typically staffed by maintenance crews who handle recycling, waste processing, and resource reclamation.

The corridors here smell faintly of disinfectant and recycled air. You can hear the hum of the processing equipment working constantly to turn the station's waste into usable water and raw materials.

You find Maintenance Chief Rodriguez working alone at one of the processing stations. He's a burly man in his fifties with decades of experience on space stations.

"Chen," he grunts in greeting. "You lost?"

"No, sir. I was just... " You pause, unsure how to phrase your concerns without sounding paranoid.

Rodriguez saves you the trouble. "You were wondering if anything odd has been happening in this section. Answer is yes." He wipes his hands on a rag and gestures for you to follow him deeper into the facility.

He leads you to a storage area and points to several large containers. "These arrived on the last supply shipment. Manifest says they're chemical supplies for the recycling process. But look at this." He opens one of the containers.

Inside are not chemicals, but packed rations—military-grade survival supplies. Enough food to keep fifty people alive for months.

"Someone's preparing for a long-term occupation," Rodriguez says quietly. "And they're using my facility to hide their supplies. I reported it to Captain Okafor three days ago. She thanked me and told me to forget about it. So I'm telling you instead."

**What do you do?**
- Ask Rodriguez what else he's discovered → Go to Section 244
- Take evidence and report to Security Chief Ramos → Go to Section 4
- Investigate the other containers in the storage area → Go to Section 247

---

### Section 40

You pocket the data chip that Lieutenant Santos gave you, the small device feeling heavy with significance. "I'll keep it safe," you promise.

Santos nods, her hand still on her sidearm as the emergency lights cast strange shadows across the mess hall. The other crew members seem oblivious to your quiet conversation, focused on their own worried discussions.

"Good," Santos says. "Don't access the data here. Too easy to trace. Wait until—"

She's interrupted by an announcement over the station's PA system: "All personnel, this is Captain Okafor. We have a situation requiring immediate attention. Department heads report to the command center. All other personnel remain at your current locations and await further instructions."

The mess hall erupts in confused murmurs. Santos's expression hardens. "That's it. They're making their move." She turns to you urgently. "That data chip contains details about the station's real purpose and the conspiracy to take control. You need to get to a secure terminal and broadcast that information to the entire crew before they can stop you."

"Who's 'they'?"

"I wish I knew everyone involved. But I know some of them are in the command structure. That's why I didn't trust bringing this up through normal channels." She grips your shoulder. "The communications center has a broadcast override that can push a message to every terminal on the station. Can you get there?"

Before you can answer, the lights flicker again—longer this time. When they come back up, three armed security personnel enter the mess hall, and they're looking directly at Lieutenant Santos.

**What do you do?**
- Create a distraction so Santos can escape → Go to Section 250
- Try to slip out of the mess hall with the data chip → Go to Section 253
- Stand with Santos and see what the security team wants → Go to Section 256

---

### Section 41

*[Branch continues from earlier paths]*

The airlock maintenance shaft is a cramped service corridor that runs along the outer hull of the station. Few people come here except during scheduled inspections. The corridor is cold—you can feel the chill of space just beyond the thin hull.

You're checking the airlock seals when you notice something unusual: fresh scratches around one of the access panels, as if someone has been opening it recently. You pull out your toolkit and carefully remove the panel.

Inside the wall cavity, you find a package carefully wrapped in thermal insulation. Your heart races as you unwrap it, revealing several data storage devices and a handwritten note.

The note reads: *"If you're reading this, I'm probably dead. Morrison, Chief Engineer. What they're doing in Lab 3 must be stopped. The entity they're studying isn't just a sample—it's a fragment of something much larger, and it's calling to its kind. The approaching ship isn't human. Destroy the sample before they arrive. Trust no one in the command structure. They've been compromised."*

Your hands shake as you hold the note. Morrison—the engineer who supposedly transferred off the station before you arrived. Was he killed to keep this secret?

The data devices could contain crucial evidence, but you'll need to find a secure terminal to access them. And the note's warning—"trust no one in the command structure"—makes everything more complicated.

You hear a sound from the corridor behind you. Someone's coming.

**What do you do?**
- Hide Morrison's package and pretend to do routine maintenance → Go to Section 259
- Grab the package and run → Go to Section 262
- Prepare to defend yourself → Go to Section 265

---

### Section 42

*[Path continues]*

The botany laboratory is adjacent to the hydroponics bay, a smaller space where Jamie and the other botanists conduct experiments on plant growth in zero gravity and study how various Earth plants adapt to the station's environment.

When you enter, you find the lab in disarray. Equipment is scattered, specimen containers are open, and soil is spilled across the workbenches. This isn't the normal organized chaos of scientific work—someone searched this place, and they didn't care about being careful.

You're examining the damage when you notice one of the growth chambers is still active, its interior light glowing. Inside, instead of a plant, there's a small device—similar to the one you saw in the hydroponics bay, but this one is clearly damaged, with scorch marks across its surface.

Next to the growth chamber is Jamie's research notebook, lying open to a page with hurried handwriting:

*"Day 67: Found another transmitter in Section C-7. Makes three total. Someone is definitely monitoring the station's activities and sending data off-site. Brought this one back to analyze. Signal frequency suggests quantum entanglement communication—real-time messaging across vast distances. This technology is decades beyond anything I've seen. Who made these? Who are they reporting to?"*

The entry is dated yesterday. Jamie knew about the spy devices but hadn't told anyone—or had they? Maybe that's what the mysterious meeting in Lab 3 was about.

You hear footsteps approaching the lab. Multiple people, moving quickly.

**What do you do?**
- Take the notebook and the damaged device and hide → Go to Section 268
- Stay and confront whoever's coming → Go to Section 271
- Escape through the connection to the hydroponics bay → Go to Section 9

---

### Section 43

"Lieutenant Santos, what's on this chip?" you ask urgently, glancing at the sealed device she gave you. "If you want me to protect it, I need to know what I'm protecting."

Santos looks around the darkened mess hall, then leans closer. "Information about Project Lighthouse. The station's classified mission. Three months ago, we detected a signal from deep space—not random cosmic noise, but deliberate communication. Mathematical patterns, encoded data. Proof of extraterrestrial intelligence."

You feel your breath catch. "Aliens?"

"More than that. The signal contained coordinates and a timeline. Someone—something—was telling us they were coming here, to this system, to this station. Captain Okafor reported it to Earth Command. Their response..." She pauses. "They ordered us to prepare for first contact."

"Then what's the problem? Why all the secrecy and conspiracy?"

"Because not everyone agrees with Earth Command's plan. A faction within the government wants to capture whatever arrives and weaponize their technology. They sent operatives to take control of the station before the contact occurs. That ship approaching—the Horizon—it's full of military contractors working for that faction."

"And the sample in Lab 3?"

"Not a sample. It's a beacon. The alien signal led Dr. Hassan to discover it on the moon's surface. It's been broadcasting since we brought it aboard, guiding the aliens here. Some people want to use it as bait. Others want to return it and make peaceful contact." She grips your arm. "That chip contains evidence of the conspiracy and the orders from Earth Command. If the crew knows the truth, they can decide for themselves what side to take."

**What do you do?**
- Trust Santos and head to the communications center to broadcast the data → Go to Section 274
- Ask why she doesn't broadcast it herself → Go to Section 277
- Question if this might be a trap → Go to Section 280

---

### Section 44

*[Branch path]*

You make your way to the Station commander's quarters, a rarely visited part of the station. Captain Okafor's private cabin is larger than the standard crew quarters but still modest by Earth standards. The door is locked, as expected.

You're about to leave when you notice the door isn't fully sealed—there's a small gap at the bottom, and you can see light coming from inside. Someone is in there, but they're not responding to the door chime.

Using your engineering access, you override the lock—a serious breach of protocol, but your instincts tell you something is wrong.

Inside, you find Captain Okafor's quarters ransacked. Drawers are open, files are scattered across the desk, and the personal computer terminal is smashed. Someone was looking for something, and they didn't find it—or they wanted to destroy evidence.

On the desk, partially hidden under scattered papers, you find a personal data pad. It's still powered on, showing the last file Okafor was reading: a classified message from Earth Command.

You read quickly:

*"Captain Okafor, the situation has evolved beyond our initial parameters. The entity in Lab 3 is confirmed as a Von Neumann probe—a self-replicating alien artifact. The approaching vessels are likely additional probes or their creators. Protocol Omega is now active: destroy the probe and evacuate the station. Do not allow first contact under any circumstances. The risk of hostile technology transfer is too high. Confirmation code: Lighthouse-Seven-Red."*

Below that is Okafor's drafted response, never sent:

*"Earth Command, I cannot in good conscience follow Protocol Omega. Destroying the probe could be interpreted as an act of hostility by an advanced alien civilization. I'm recommending we proceed with first contact as originally planned. The potential benefits outweigh—"*

The message ends there. Did someone stop her from sending it?

**What do you do?**
- Take the data pad and find Captain Okafor → Go to Section 11
- Report the ransacked quarters to Security → Go to Section 4
- Search the quarters more thoroughly for additional evidence → Go to Section 283

### Section 45

*[Path continuation]*

The sleep pods section houses the emergency cryo-sleep units, designed to keep crew alive in case of catastrophic life support failure. It's a quiet, clinical area that few people visit unless they're undergoing routine cryo-certification training.

When you arrive, you're surprised to find Dr. Yuki already there, inspecting one of the pods. She looks up, startled.

"Alex. I didn't expect anyone else to come here."

"I was just... looking around. Trying to understand what's happening." You notice she's holding a medical scanner. "What are you doing?"

Dr. Yuki hesitates, then makes a decision. "Come here. I need to show you something."

She opens one of the sleep pods. Inside, instead of empty padding, there's a person—and not one you recognize. They're unconscious, connected to life support systems, with monitoring equipment attached.

"I found them three days ago," Dr. Yuki says quietly. "Someone put them in here without medical authorization or logging it in the system. I've been keeping them stable while trying to figure out who they are."

She shows you her medical scan results. "Their identification chip has been removed. But based on their biometrics and the scarring pattern from military-grade augmentations, I believe they're a special operations soldier. Someone tried to hide them here."

"Why?"

"I don't know. But their neural patterns show signs of memory suppression drugs. Someone didn't want them talking." Dr. Yuki looks at you seriously. "I can wake them up. The drugs will have worn off by now. But once I do, there's no going back. We'll have to deal with whoever this person is and whatever they know."

**What do you do?**
- Agree to wake up the mysterious person → Go to Section 286
- Suggest reporting this to Captain Okafor first → Go to Section 11
- Question Dr. Yuki about why she didn't report this earlier → Go to Section 289

---

### Section 46

"Lieutenant Santos," you say, "we should head to the command center together. Captain Okafor needs to know what's on that chip."

Santos considers this for a moment, then nods. "You're right. The Captain deserves to make an informed decision before the Horizon arrives."

She stands, and you follow her out of the mess hall. The corridors are busier now, with crew members hurrying to their stations in response to the emergency protocols. No one pays special attention to you as you make your way through the station.

As you approach the command center, Santos suddenly grabs your arm and pulls you into a side corridor.

"Wait. Look." She points toward the command center entrance.

Two guards stand at the entrance—not the usual security personnel, but individuals you don't recognize. They're wearing station security uniforms, but something about their bearing suggests military special forces rather than civilian security.

"Those aren't our guards," Santos whispers. "Someone's already taken control of the command center."

Before you can respond, you hear Captain Okafor's voice echoing from inside: "This is my station, Commander Zhang. I will not surrender command to you or anyone else."

Zhang's voice responds, cold and controlled: "You don't have a choice, Captain. Earth Command's orders are clear. When the Horizon docks, operational command transfers to the special security team. You've been relieved."

A coup. You're witnessing a coup against the station's captain.

**What do you do?**
- Try to enter the command center to support Captain Okafor → Go to Section 292
- Find another way to help the Captain → Go to Section 295
- Use the data chip to gather more allies before confronting Zhang → Go to Section 298

### Section 47

*[Additional branch]*

The science laboratory wing contains multiple specialized research spaces. You walk through the quiet corridors, noting which labs are active and which are dark. Most of the scientific staff should be at their stations during the emergency, but the wing seems deserted.

You try the door to Lab 1—the xenobiology research space. It's unlocked, which is unusual for a restricted research area. Inside, you find a pristine laboratory with advanced analysis equipment, specimen storage units, and research terminals.

On one of the terminals, a program is running—some kind of analysis on biological samples. You approach and see that it's analyzing the alien artifact from Lab 3, running simulations of its molecular structure.

The results are fascinating and terrifying: the artifact isn't a machine in the traditional sense. It's bio-mechanical, with organic components that can self-replicate using raw materials. The simulation shows how it could theoretically convert any matter into copies of itself.

A text file is open on another screen—Dr. Hassan's research notes:

*"Day 89: The artifact's self-replication capability is far beyond our technology. If even a small fragment were to begin uncontrolled replication, it could consume the entire station in approximately 14 hours. However, it appears to be dormant, waiting for something. Perhaps a signal? More study needed. Have requested Earth Command delay the contact timeline, but they're not responding to my recommendations."*

Below that, a more recent entry:

*"Day 95: They're not listening. The military contractors arriving on the Horizon plan to forcibly activate the artifact's replication to study the process. This could be catastrophic. Must find a way to destroy the artifact before they arrive, but Captain Okafor won't authorize it. Running out of options."*

You hear a sound from the corridor. Someone's coming to the lab.

**What do you do?**
- Hide and see who enters → Go to Section 301
- Confront Dr. Hassan about his research → Go to Section 10
- Copy the research data and leave quickly → Go to Section 304

### Section 48

You decide to try contacting Captain Okafor directly. Using your terminal, you send a priority message to her personal communication channel: "Captain, this is Alex Chen. I've discovered evidence of unauthorized access and potential conspiracy. Request immediate meeting."

The response comes faster than you expected: "Chen. Meet me in my ready room in five minutes. Come alone."

You make your way to the command center area, your mind racing. Captain Okafor has always been fair and professional in your limited interactions, but can you really trust her with what you've discovered?

When you arrive at her ready room, the door slides open immediately. Inside, you find Captain Okafor standing at the viewport, looking out at the stars. She doesn't turn when you enter.

"Close the door, Alex."

You do so, and she finally faces you. She looks exhausted, with dark circles under her eyes.

"You found something in the system logs," she says—not a question, a statement. "I've been monitoring access to sensitive files. I know you've been investigating."

"Captain, I—"

She holds up a hand. "Don't apologize. You should be investigating. Someone needs to." She moves to her desk and activates a holographic display showing the station's schematic. "I've been watching a conspiracy unfold aboard my own station, and I haven't been able to stop it because I don't know the full extent of who's involved."

She highlights several sections of the station. "Unauthorized access here, here, and here. Power fluctuations suggesting hidden equipment. Communications being monitored and intercepted. And through it all, I've been receiving contradictory orders from Earth Command—some telling me to prepare for peaceful first contact, others ordering me to destroy the artifact and evacuate."

"Which orders are real?"

"I don't know anymore. That's the problem. Someone is manipulating the communication streams, either here or at Earth Command itself." She looks at you intently. "I need someone I can trust absolutely. Someone with no prior connections to this conspiracy. I'm betting my command—and possibly my life—that you're that person."

**What do you do?**
- Pledge your loyalty to Captain Okafor → Go to Section 307
- Share everything you've discovered with her → Go to Section 310
- Ask what she wants you to do → Go to Section 313

### Section 49

*[Path extension]*

The corridor designated as C-Deck contains crew quarters and common areas. You're walking through when you notice one of the quarters has its door control panel damaged, sparking slightly. That's a safety hazard that should be reported.

As you approach to log the malfunction, you hear voices from inside the room—and one of them belongs to Jamie.

"I told you, I need more time," Jamie says, sounding stressed. "I can't just access those files without someone noticing."

A male voice responds: "You've had enough time. The Horizon docks in two hours. We need that data before they arrive, or the whole operation is compromised."

"And if I get caught? They'll know someone's been accessing classified research."

"Then don't get caught. You're a smart botanist who happens to share a lab space with the xenobiology team. You have a reason to be in those systems." The man's voice turns threatening. "Remember what's at stake here, Jamie. Your cooperation is the only thing keeping you off the casualty list."

You hear movement inside—they're coming toward the door. You have only seconds to decide what to do.

**What do you do?**
- Confront them as they exit → Go to Section 316
- Hide and follow them when they leave → Go to Section 319
- Retreat and report to Security Chief Ramos → Go to Section 4

### Section 50

You quickly duck behind a row of hydroponic growing stations, making yourself as small as possible among the plants. The humid air and the sounds of the water systems help mask any noise you might make.

Two people enter the hydroponics bay. One is Dr. Hassan, the xenobiologist. The other is a woman you don't recognize—she's wearing a civilian jumpsuit, but something about her bearing suggests military training.

"The device is still here," the woman says, moving directly toward where you found the metallic object. "Good. We'll need to relocate it before Chen or one of the other engineers finds it."

"I told you planting it in the hydroponics bay was too risky," Dr. Hassan says nervously. "Too many people work in here."

"It needed to be near organic matter to disguise its energy signature. The plants provide perfect cover." She picks up the device and examines it. "Besides, it's done its job. The resonance field has been active for two weeks. Everyone on the station has been exposed."

"And you're sure it's worked? They all seem normal to me."

The woman laughs coldly. "That's the point. The field doesn't change behavior—it just makes people more suggestible, more likely to follow authority, less likely to question unusual orders. When the Horizon's team takes command, the crew will comply without resistance."

Your blood runs cold. They've been using some kind of mind-control technology on the entire station.

"What about the ones it doesn't work on?" Dr. Hassan asks. "You said some people would be naturally resistant."

"We've identified most of them. They'll be dealt with when the time comes." The woman pockets the device. "Come on. We need to report to Commander Zhang that Phase Two is complete."

They start to leave, but Dr. Hassan pauses. "I still don't feel right about this. We're scientists, not military operatives."

"You made your choice when you accepted the funding for your research. Now you live with it." They exit the bay.

**What do you do?**
- Follow them to see where they go → Go to Section 322
- Try to warn the crew about the mind control → Go to Section 325
- Find Captain Okafor immediately → Go to Section 48

### Section 53

You grab the metallic device from the soil and stand up, facing the entrance to the hydroponics bay. Whoever's coming needs to answer some questions about what this thing is doing here.

Dr. Hassan enters, and he stops short when he sees you holding the device. His expression shifts from surprise to concern.

"Alex. Put that down. Very carefully."

"Not until you tell me what it is." You hold it up. "This isn't standard equipment. What have you been hiding in here?"

Dr. Hassan's hand moves toward his pocket, but he stops himself. He takes a breath and seems to make a decision. "That device... it's part of my research. But not the research I tell everyone about."

He approaches slowly, hands visible. "Please. Don't activate it. It's a resonance emitter, designed to interact with the alien artifact in Lab 3. If you press the wrong button, you could send a signal that we don't understand and can't control."

"Why would you hide it in the hydroponics bay?"

"Because I'm trying to protect this station. There are people here—operatives sent by a faction on Earth—who want to activate the artifact and weaponize it. I've been conducting secret research to find a way to disable it instead. This device can disrupt the artifact's signal, but it needs to be hidden until I'm ready to use it."

He extends his hand. "Please trust me, Alex. I know how this looks, but I'm trying to save lives. Give me the device, and I'll explain everything. But we need to move quickly—the Horizon will be here soon, and when those operatives take control, they won't listen to reason."

**What do you do?**
- Give Dr. Hassan the device and hear his full explanation → Go to Section 10
- Refuse and demand he prove his story → Go to Section 328
- Keep the device and run to report this to Captain Okafor → Go to Section 48

### Section 56

You leave the device where it is and turn away from it, pretending to inspect the wilted plants nearby. When Dr. Hassan enters the hydroponics bay, you look up casually.

"Oh, Dr. Hassan. Have you seen Jamie? I was looking for them."

Hassan seems relieved to see you doing something normal. "No, I haven't seen them today. Are these plants looking unwell? That's unusual—Jamie is usually very attentive."

"Yes, some of them seem to need water and nutrients." You gesture to the affected plants. "I was going to let someone know."

"I'll inform the botany team." Hassan starts to move toward the back of the bay—right where the device is hidden. You need to distract him.

"Dr. Hassan, can I ask you something? About the sample in Lab 3?"

He stops and turns, immediately wary. "How do you know about that? Lab 3 is restricted."

"I... overheard some scientists talking. They said you found something on the moon's surface. I'm curious—as an engineer, I mean. If we're discovering new things out here, that's exciting."

Hassan relaxes slightly, clearly torn between caution and his natural enthusiasm for his work. "It is exciting. Potentially the most significant discovery in human history. But also dangerous, which is why it's classified."

"Dangerous how?"

He glances around, making sure you're alone. "Come with me to Lab 3. I'll show you—better than trying to explain. But you must promise not to discuss what you see with anyone without my permission."

**What do you do?**
- Accept Hassan's invitation to visit Lab 3 → Go to Section 10
- Decline and try to return to retrieve the device later → Go to Section 331
- Ask more questions about the danger → Go to Section 334

### Section 58

"Dr. Hassan," you ask, staring at the glowing sample in the containment chamber, "what has it been communicating?"

Hassan exchanges a glance with Dr. Park, then pulls up a data visualization on his terminal. "We've been detecting modulated electromagnetic signals emanating from the sample. At first, we thought it was just radiation from whatever power source it contains. But Dr. Park here—she's a cryptographer—recognized patterns."

Dr. Park nods and takes over the explanation. "The signals contain repeating mathematical sequences. Prime numbers, pi to hundreds of decimal places, the Fibonacci sequence. Classic first-contact protocols—ways to prove intelligence without assuming shared language."

"You mean it's trying to talk to us?"

"Not to us," Hassan corrects. "We've triangulated the signal direction. It's broadcasting into deep space, toward the approaching ship. The sample is a beacon, calling to something out there."

The third scientist, whom no one has introduced, speaks up: "And whatever it's calling to is answering. We've detected response signals coming from the Horizon. That ship isn't human, Alex. It's them—the ones who left this beacon here."

You feel your worldview tilting. "Then why all the secrecy? This is first contact with an alien civilization. Earth should know."

"Earth does know," Hassan says grimly. "Earth Command's response was to send a covert military team to seize the artifact and prepare weapons. They want to capture the aliens' technology, not make peace. That's what the Horizon actually is—not aliens, but human special forces pretending to be a relief ship."

"Wait," you say, confused. "Then what's sending the response signals?"

Hassan turns back to the glowing artifact. "That's the terrifying part. Something else is coming. A real alien ship, following the beacon's call. It'll arrive approximately six hours after the Horizon docks. We'll have Earth's military forces here, trying to weaponize the artifact, when the actual aliens arrive. It's a recipe for disaster."

**What do you do?**
- Ask what they plan to do about it → Go to Section 337
- Question how they know the second ship is alien → Go to Section 340

### Section 61

"Dr. Hassan," you say carefully, "why was this kept secret from the crew? If this is the discovery of the century, why hide it?"

Hassan's expression darkens. "Because we couldn't agree on what to do with it. When I first found the artifact and reported it to Captain Okafor, she immediately contacted Earth Command. Their response was... concerning. They didn't send scientists. They sent military advisors."

Dr. Park adds, "Earth Command classified the discovery under military protocols. They ordered us to continue studying the artifact in secret while they 'prepared appropriate response teams.' Those teams are on the Horizon."

"We objected," Hassan continues. "This should be handled by the scientific community, by diplomats, not soldiers. But we were overruled. Captain Okafor tried to push back, but Earth Command threatened to relieve her of command if she didn't comply."

The third scientist finally introduces himself: "I'm Dr. Marcus Reeves, astrophysics. What they're not telling you is that some of us agreed with the military approach. If this artifact can self-replicate and its creators are hostile, weaponizing it might be our only defense."

Hassan shoots him a sharp look. "We don't know they're hostile. Making that assumption could doom us to a war we started."

"And assuming they're friendly could doom us to extinction," Reeves counters.

You're watching two scientific philosophies clash in real time: hope versus fear, cooperation versus preparation for conflict.

### Section 64

"Is this emergency connected to the artifact?" you ask, looking between the three scientists. "Did something go wrong?"

Hassan shakes his head. "Not with the artifact itself. But someone sabotaged our communications array to prevent us from contacting Earth Command with updated findings. We discovered something yesterday—something that changes everything about the artifact's purpose."

Dr. Park pulls up a new visualization. "We successfully decoded part of the artifact's signal. It's not just calling its creators. It's transmitting a detailed scan of our station, our technology level, our biological makeup. It's gathering intelligence."

"For what purpose?" you ask.

"That's what we can't determine," Hassan admits. "It could be benign—a first contact protocol to understand us before meeting. Or it could be reconnaissance for an invasion. The data is ambiguous."

Dr. Reeves speaks up: "Which is why I reported our findings to someone I knew would take action. Someone who understands that in uncertain situations, you prepare for the worst."

"You contacted the Horizon team behind our backs," Hassan says accusingly. "You told them about the intelligence-gathering function."

"Yes. And now they're coming with the authorization and equipment to either secure the artifact or destroy it before the aliens arrive. We can't risk first contact when we don't know their intentions."

Hassan turns to you desperately. "Alex, we need help. If the military team gets control of the artifact, they'll either weaponize it or destroy it. Both options could provoke a hostile response from an advanced civilization. We need to find another way."

**What do you do?**
- Help Hassan protect the artifact from the military team → Go to Section 355

"Captain, I'll follow your orders," you say without hesitation. In a crisis, someone needs to be in command, and Captain Okafor has the experience and authority.

Okafor nods, a hint of relief crossing her face. "Good. I need you to do something that may seem strange, but it's crucial. I'm going to send you to the lower engineering levels to manually activate an emergency system—one that's not in the standard operations manual."

Commander Zhang starts to object, but Okafor silences him with a look.

"This station has a fail-safe system installed during construction," she explains. "If activated, it creates a quantum communication link directly to Earth Command that can't be jammed or intercepted. The previous Chief Engineer Morrison helped design it before he... left."

You notice the hesitation before "left." Morrison didn't leave—something happened to him.

"The activation console is in Section E-7, sublevel 3. It's behind a sealed hatch marked with a yellow triangle." She transfers access codes to your tablet. "Once activated, the link will allow me to communicate directly with the actual Earth Command—not whatever compromised channel we've been using. Can you do this?"

"Yes, Captain."

"One more thing. There may be people on this station who don't want that link established. If anyone tries to stop you..." She pauses. "Use your best judgment. But complete the mission."

**What do you do?**
- Head immediately to activate the quantum link → Go to Section 361

"Captain," you say carefully, "I'd like to know what the assignment is before I commit to it."

Okafor studies you for a moment, then nods. "Fair enough. Trust should be earned, not demanded." She pulls up a secure file on her display. "I need you to access the station's auxiliary power core and install this program."

She shows you the code. Your engineering training immediately recognizes what it does: it's a lockdown protocol that would seal all docking ports and prevent any ship from boarding the station.

"You want to prevent the Horizon from docking?" you ask.

"Not prevent—delay. I need six more hours to verify the authenticity of the conflicting orders I've been receiving. If the Horizon docks before then, whoever's aboard will take control of the station under martial law protocols, and I'll lose the ability to make independent decisions."

Commander Zhang's voice is cold. "Captain, you're proposing mutiny against legitimate Earth Command authority."

"I'm proposing due diligence in a situation with contradictory intelligence," Okafor counters. "If the orders are legitimate, I'll comply. But I will not hand over my station based on possibly falsified communications."

She turns back to you. "The program needs to be installed from a physical terminal in the auxiliary core. It can't be done remotely—another safety feature. I'm asking you to do this because my actions are being monitored too closely. Will you help me?"

**What do you do?**
- Agree to install the lockdown protocol → Go to Section 370

"Commander Zhang," you say, "I think we deserve to know about the approaching ship. What exactly is the Horizon?"

Captain Okafor's expression hardens, but Zhang looks almost satisfied that someone is questioning her authority.

"The Horizon," Zhang says, "is a rapid response vessel dispatched by Earth Command when we reported the alien artifact. It's carrying a specialized team trained in xenological threats—scientists, military advisors, and security personnel who can properly handle first contact scenarios."

"That's the official designation," Okafor interrupts. "The reality is more complicated. Commander, tell them who's really commanding the Horizon."

Zhang hesitates, then continues: "The ship is under the authority of Special Directive Seven—a black operations unit that handles potential existential threats to humanity. Yes, they have military capabilities. That's necessary when dealing with unknown alien technology."

"Special Directive Seven has a different mandate than peaceful exploration," Okafor says, her voice tight with controlled anger. "They're authorized to use any means necessary to secure alien technology, including lethal force against civilians if deemed necessary for planetary security."

"Only in extreme circumstances," Zhang argues. "And given that we have a self-replicating alien artifact of unknown purpose broadcasting intelligence about humanity into deep space, I'd say we're in extreme circumstances."

Okafor looks at you. "Alex, I need you to understand what's at stake. If SD-7 takes control, everyone on this station becomes expendable in the name of securing that artifact. I won't let that happen to my crew."

**What do you do?**
- Support Captain Okafor's resistance to SD-7 → Go to Section 67

You press yourself against the wall and listen carefully to the voices coming from behind the sealed hatch. There are at least three people inside, and they're arguing.

"—telling you, the timeline has moved up. The Horizon will be here in ninety minutes, not three hours. We need to secure the artifact now."

A woman's voice responds: "We can't move it without proper containment. You saw what happened when Rodriguez tried to handle a fragment—his hands were covered in molecular burns for a week."

"Then we activate it in place. The team on the Horizon will have proper containment."

"Activating it is insane! We don't know what it will do. It could start replicating uncontrollably."

A third voice—one you recognize as Lieutenant Santos: "Then what do you suggest? Let Okafor destroy it? She's already discussing Protocol Omega with her loyal officers. If we don't secure the artifact, all this planning is for nothing."

You feel a chill. Lieutenant Santos—the person who gave you the data chip—is part of whatever group is planning to seize the artifact. Was the chip a plant? A way to identify who you'd report to?

"Santos is right," the first voice says. "We move in twenty minutes. Hassan will disable the containment field remotely, we extract the artifact, and we meet the Horizon team at docking bay two. Anyone who interferes gets detained. Okafor, Torres, Ramos—all of them."

"What about the kid? Chen?"

"Still trying to figure out whose side they're on. Keep monitoring them. If they become a problem, we'll deal with it."

They're wrapping up their meeting. You need to move.

You immediately contact Chief Torres via your communicator. "Chief, I found the junction box in Sector 7. This wasn't a malfunction—someone deliberately sabotaged it."

There's a pause, then Torres responds: "Stay where you are. I'm coming to you. Don't touch anything else."

Five minutes later, Torres arrives with Ensign Webb. She examines the sabotaged junction box with a practiced eye, taking readings with her engineering scanner.

"This was done by someone who knew exactly what they were doing," she mutters. "The disconnections were precise—designed to cause power fluctuations without triggering automatic safety responses. Professional work."

"Chief," you say, "I found boot prints leading to a sealed hatch. Someone might still be down there."

Torres exchanges a glance with Webb. "Show me."

You lead them to the sealed hatch. Torres tries her access code, and surprisingly, it works. The hatch opens to reveal a ladder leading down into darkness.

"This shouldn't be here," Webb says, checking his tablet. "This hatch isn't on any current station schematics."

"It's from the original construction," Torres says grimly. "Most of these old access points were sealed during the final build. Someone unsealed it." She activates a flashlight and starts climbing down. "Come on. Let's see what they're hiding."

You descend into a narrow tunnel that runs beneath the main station levels. The air is stale, and you can see evidence of recent activity—disturbed dust, discarded equipment wrappers.

The tunnel opens into a small chamber, and what you find there is shocking: a complete hidden operations center with communications equipment, weapons, and surveillance monitors showing live feeds from throughout the station.

"This is a staging area," Torres whispers, examining the equipment. "Someone's been planning a takeover operation for months."

**What do you do?**

You open the hatch fully and step through, ready to confront whoever is on the other side. The space beyond is a small control room filled with makeshift equipment and monitoring stations.

Three people turn to face you, and you recognize all of them: Ensign Marcus Webb from engineering, Dr. Amelia Park from the cryptography team, and Maintenance Chief Rodriguez.

"Alex," Rodriguez says calmly, his hand moving subtly toward something behind him. "This is unexpected."

"What are you doing down here? What is all this equipment?"

Webb steps forward, his usual nervous demeanor replaced by cold calculation. "We're trying to save the station. Though I suppose how you define 'save' depends on your perspective."

Dr. Park adds, "We've been monitoring the conspiracy to seize the alien artifact. We know about the Horizon, about Special Directive Seven, about Commander Zhang's coup plans. We've been gathering evidence to expose them."

"By building a secret surveillance center?" you challenge. "That doesn't sound like evidence gathering. That sounds like you're running your own operation."

Rodriguez nods slowly. "Perceptive. Yes, we're running our own operation. Because the official channels are compromised. Captain Okafor is a good officer, but she's bound by protocol and orders. We're not."

Webb explains: "We represent a third faction in this conflict. Not Okafor's loyalists, not Zhang's military hardliners, not Hassan's naive scientists. We're people who understand that in an information war, you need your own intelligence network."

"What's your goal?" you ask.

"Survive first contact without getting everyone killed," Rodriguez says bluntly. "And we could use someone like you—someone who's been poking around, asking questions, not blindly following either side. Interested?"

"I'll come with you, Chief," you say to Ramos. "If there's a conspiracy, we need to uncover it."

Ramos nods and hands you a small device. "This is a non-lethal stunner. I hope you won't need it, but if things get dangerous, don't hesitate to defend yourself."

You take the weapon, its weight feeling strange in your hand. You've never carried a weapon before.

Together, you make your way through the station toward the maintenance level below the cargo bay. The corridors become less maintained, the lighting more sparse. This is the station's underbelly, where the machinery that keeps everyone alive does its unglamorous work.

Ramos leads you to a hatch marked "RESTRICTED - MAINTENANCE ONLY." He overrides the lock with his security credentials, and the hatch opens with a hiss of equalizing pressure.

Below is a maze of pipes, conduits, and support structures. And in the middle of it, you see signs of habitation: sleeping bags, portable heaters, food containers. Someone has definitely been living down here.

"Spread out but stay in visual contact," Ramos whispers. "Look for anything that might tell us who they are or what they're planning."

You search carefully, and behind a large coolant tank, you find something significant: a weapons locker containing pulse rifles and tactical gear. More than enough to arm a small squad.

As you're examining the weapons, you hear movement. Someone's coming down the ladder into the maintenance level.

Ramos signals you to take cover. You hide behind a support beam as three figures descend—all wearing unmarked military gear, armed and moving with professional precision.

"The timeline has accelerated," one of them says into a communicator. "We're moving to Phase Three immediately. Secure the artifact, disable station defenses, and hold the command center until the Horizon docks."

"Chief," you say, "maybe we can repair one of the escape pods. Get the launch mechanisms working again."

Ramos considers this. "It's possible, but it would take time. And whoever disabled them would notice us trying to fix them. They've probably got surveillance on the pod bays."

"Unless we're subtle about it," you suggest. "I'm an engineer. I can make it look like routine maintenance while actually bypassing the lockouts."

Ramos smiles grimly. "That's thinking like a survivor. Alright. But we're not just fixing one pod. If things go bad, a lot of people might need to evacuate. We fix as many as we can quietly."

Over the next hour, you and Ramos work systematically through the escape pod systems. The sabotage was clever—whoever did it knew exactly which components to disable to prevent launch without obviously damaging the pods. It takes all your engineering skill to reverse it without triggering alerts.

As you're finishing the third pod, your communicator chirps. It's a station-wide announcement from Captain Okafor: "All hands, the approaching vessel has been identified as the EDF Horizon under Special Directive Seven command. I am implementing station-wide security protocol Amber. All personnel report to designated safe zones. This is not a drill."

Ramos's expression is grave. "Protocol Amber means Okafor expects potential hostile action against the station itself. She's preparing for a fight."

Around you, crew members start hurrying toward safe zones. Some look confused, others frightened.

"We need to make a decision," Ramos says. "Finish repairing the pods and help people evacuate if necessary, or report to security and help defend the station?"

**What do you do?**
- Continue repairing pods to ensure evacuation option → Go to Section 400
- Report to security to help defend the station → Go to Section 4
- Try to reach Captain Okafor to understand the situation → Go to Section 11

"Chief Ramos," you say, "before we do anything, I need to hear your theory. What do you think is really happening?"

Ramos sits down on one of the disabled escape pods and gestures for you to do the same. "I think there are at least three different groups with three different agendas all converging on this station at the same time."

He counts on his fingers: "First, there's Captain Okafor and her loyalists. They want to handle first contact peacefully, follow proper protocols, and keep the crew safe. Second, there's Commander Zhang and whoever he's working with—probably Special Directive Seven. They want to secure the alien artifact by any means necessary, treat this as a potential threat."

"And the third group?"

"The intruders. The ones who smuggled themselves aboard months ago. I think they're corporate agents or private military contractors working for someone who wants the artifact for themselves—not for Earth Command, not for humanity, but for profit or power."

You feel a chill. "So we're caught in the middle of a three-way conflict over alien technology?"

"Exactly. And when the Horizon arrives, all three sides are going to make their move. It's going to get messy, and regular crew members like us are going to be collateral damage unless we're smart." He stands. "That's why I've been quietly identifying people I can trust and making contingency plans. People who will prioritize survival over taking sides in someone else's war."

"What kind of contingency plans?"

"Escape routes. Safe zones. Ways to get off the station if it becomes a battlefield." He looks at you seriously. "I'm putting together a group to protect ourselves and any crew who don't want to be pawns. You're young, smart, and you've proven you can think independently. I want you with us."

"I'll help you with the engineering tasks," you tell Webb. The station's systems need to be maintained, regardless of what conspiracy is unfolding.

Webb looks relieved. "Thank you. I'm way out of my depth here. The plasma distributor is showing instability, and I don't know if it's related to the sabotage or just bad timing."

You work together for the next thirty minutes, troubleshooting the power distribution systems. As you work, you notice something odd in the energy flow patterns. There's a significant power draw coming from an unauthorized location—the lower engineering levels, specifically Section E-7.

"Webb, look at this. Someone's running a massive system down in E-7, but there's nothing on the schematics that should draw this much power."

Webb checks his own terminal. "You're right. That's... that's almost as much power as the main lab systems. What could they be running down there?"

Before you can investigate further, Jamie's tablet buzzes again: "Last warning. If you don't come to Lab 3 now, you're making a choice. -M"

Webb sees the message. "That's not your tablet. Whose is it?"

You explain about finding it in Jamie's room, about the mysterious meetings. Webb's expression grows grave.

"Alex, 'M' could be Morrison. The previous chief engineer."

"But Morrison transferred off the station weeks ago."

"That's what we were told. But what if he didn't? What if he's been hiding on the station this whole time?" Webb pulls up some old engineering logs. "Look at these. Morrison was investigating unauthorized power draws in the weeks before he supposedly left. The same kind we're seeing now."

**What do you do?**
- Go to Lab 3 to find out who 'M' is → Go to Section 10

You make your way to the cargo bay, following the path Chief Torres took. The cargo bay is massive, filled with shipping containers and supplies. In the dim emergency lighting, the shadows between containers create a maze-like environment.

"Chief Torres?" you call out. Your voice echoes in the vast space.

No response.

You move deeper into the bay, following a logical search pattern. That's when you hear voices—low, urgent conversation coming from behind a stack of containers marked "SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT - FRAGILE."

You move closer quietly and recognize Torres's voice: "—don't care what your orders are. I'm not going to help you weaponize alien technology."

A man's voice responds: "You don't have a choice, Chief. Either you help us modify the power systems to contain the artifact when we move it, or we'll find another engineer. One who's more... compliant."

"Are you threatening me?"

"I'm stating facts. The Horizon arrives in seventy minutes. When it does, we're extracting the artifact whether you help or not. If you cooperate, you'll be rewarded. If you don't..." The threat hangs in the air.

You peek around the container and see Torres facing off against three people in unmarked tactical gear. They're armed, and Torres is alone.

You stare at the message on Jamie's tablet: "Where are you? We're waiting. This is important. -M"

Your fingers hover over the virtual keyboard. You could respond, pretend to be Jamie, and find out what this mysterious meeting is about. Or you could ignore it and focus on the larger emergency.

You make a decision and type: "On my way. Sorry for the delay."

The response is almost immediate: "Hurry. We're running out of time. The Horizon's arrival changes everything. We need to act now."

You pocket the tablet and head toward Lab 3. The corridors are busier now, with crew members moving purposefully toward their emergency stations. No one pays attention to you as you make your way through the station.

When you reach Lab 3, the door is unsealed. You enter cautiously, expecting to find Dr. Hassan and his team, but instead you find something completely different.

The lab has been transformed into a command center. Multiple displays show views from throughout the station—surveillance feeds from cameras you didn't know existed. And standing at the center of it all is a man you've only seen in photos: Chief Engineer Morrison, supposedly transferred off the station weeks ago.

He's alive, and he's been hiding here all along.

"You're not Jamie," Morrison says, turning to face you. He's in his forties, with tired eyes and several weeks' worth of beard growth. "But you're using their tablet, which means either you're working with them or you're investigating. Which is it, Alex Chen?"

**What do you do?**

"We need to get to the docking section!" you shout over the alarm. Chief Torres is already moving, grabbing emergency equipment from a locker.

You run together through the station corridors, feeling the structure shake from the explosion. Emergency bulkheads are starting to seal, automatically isolating damaged sections.

When you reach the docking section, the scene is chaotic. The inner airlock door is holding, but it's been damaged. Through the small viewport, you can see the outer docking area is partially depressurized—someone tried to blow the airlock open from the outside.

Security Chief Ramos is already there, coordinating damage control. "Torres, Chen—good timing. Someone tried to force entry through Airlock 4. The explosive was crude but effective. If the inner door had failed, we'd have lost half this section."

Torres examines the damage. "This was set from inside the station, not outside. Someone placed charges on the outer door mechanism to make it look like a boarding attempt."

"A false flag operation," you realize. "Make it look like someone's trying to break in, trigger emergency protocols, create confusion."

Ramos nods grimly. "While we're all focused here, the real operation is happening somewhere else. We've been played."

An urgent message comes over your communicator—it's Dr. Yuki from the medical bay: "Emergency! Lab 3 has been breached! Multiple casualties! I need help immediately!"

**What do you do?**
- Rush to Lab 3 to help with casualties → Go to Section 10

"Chief, we should seal the affected section immediately," you urge. "Prevent any possibility of decompression."

Torres nods and begins entering commands. "Agreed. Emergency protocol Delta—sealing docking section and surrounding corridors."

Bulkheads begin closing throughout the area, automated systems responding to Torres's commands. But something's wrong—the bulkhead controls are responding slower than they should.

"Someone's fighting me for system control," Torres says, her fingers flying across the interface. "They're trying to keep the bulkheads open."

You jump to a secondary terminal and try to assist, but you're locked out. "I can't access the safety systems. My credentials aren't working."

"Mine are being overridden too." Torres's expression is grim. "Whoever's doing this has command-level access. Either Captain Okafor or Commander Zhang is preventing us from securing the station."

The explosion occurs again—a second blast, this time closer. The lights flicker and die, replaced by emergency lighting.

"They're creating a path," you realize. "Multiple breaches to create a route through the station while preventing us from sealing it off."

Torres grabs your arm. "We need to get to the auxiliary control room. It has hardwired overrides that can't be blocked remotely. Can you get us there?"

You recall the station layout. The auxiliary control room is three decks down, through sections that may now be exposed to vacuum.

**What do you do?**

"Chief Torres," you say, "what if this wasn't an external explosion? What if someone detonated charges from inside the station to create a panic?"

Torres considers this, then begins analyzing the sensor data. "You might be right. The explosion signature is consistent with internal charges, not a boarding attempt. Someone's trying to create chaos."

She pulls up a station-wide system overview. "Look at this. While we were distracted by the explosion, someone accessed the communications array—what's left of it—and sent a burst transmission. Short range, directed at the Horizon."

"What did it say?"

"Encrypted. But the timing is suspicious. It's like they're coordinating with whoever's on that ship." Torres makes a decision. "I'm going to lock down all external communications until we figure out who's trustworthy. No one gets to talk to the Horizon until Captain Okafor authorizes it."

As she's implementing the communications blackout, your tablet chirps with a priority message from Captain Okafor: "All senior staff to the command center immediately. We have a situation."

Torres looks at you. "You're not senior staff, but you've been helpful. Want to come with me and see what the Captain has to say?"

**What do you do?**

You make your way alone through the station toward the server core, three decks below the main engineering level. The corridors here are utilitarian, designed for function rather than comfort. Few crew members come to this section unless they're performing maintenance.

The server core chamber is behind multiple security doors, each requiring Torres's access codes. As you descend, you notice how quiet it is—too quiet. The normal hum of station activity is muted down here.

You reach the final security door and enter the access code. The door slides open, revealing the server core: rows of processing units and data storage systems, the digital brain of Station Osiris.

At the center console, you find the interface for the hidden subroutine Torres discovered. You begin the shutdown procedure, carefully following her instructions.

As you're working, you hear the door open behind you. You spin around to find Ensign Webb standing there, looking nervous.

"Alex? What are you doing here? This area is restricted."

"Torres sent me. There's a hidden subroutine that needs to be disabled." You gesture to the console. "What are you doing here?"

Webb's expression shifts, becoming harder. "I'm here to make sure that subroutine stays active. I'm sorry, Alex. I like you, but you're interfering with something bigger than you understand."

He pulls out a small device—not a weapon, but some kind of remote control. "Step away from the console. I don't want to hurt you, but I will if I have to."

**What do you do?**

"Chief Torres, shouldn't I have backup for this mission? If there's danger—"

"Good thinking," Torres interrupts. "You're right." She considers for a moment. "Take Dr. Yuki with you. She's in the medical bay, and I trust her completely. Between her medical expertise and your engineering skills, you should be able to handle most situations. Plus, she can provide cover if anyone questions why you're in restricted areas—medical inspection, that sort of thing."

You make your way to the medical bay and find Dr. Yuki organizing supplies. When you explain the situation—carefully, watching for her reaction—she doesn't seem surprised.

"I've been expecting something like this," she says quietly. "Too many strange things happening, too many inconsistencies. Torres trusts you, and I trust Torres, so I'll help."

Together, you head toward the server core. Dr. Yuki carries her medical bag, which you suspect contains more than just standard medical supplies.

As you descend through the station levels, Dr. Yuki speaks softly: "Alex, there's something I haven't told anyone. That patient I mentioned with the anomalous biometrics? I've been monitoring them. They woke up two hours ago and told me some disturbing things about what's really happening on this station."

"What things?"

"They claim to be part of an Earth Defense intelligence unit sent to investigate illegal alien technology trading. They believe someone on the Horizon is planning to steal the artifact and sell it to the highest bidder, not deliver it to Earth Command."

Before you can process this, you reach the server core and find it's already occupied.

"Chief Torres, shouldn't we report this to Captain Okafor before taking action? This seems like it's beyond our authority."

Torres hesitates. "Normally, yes. But if Okafor's access codes are being used to sabotage the station, I'm not sure she's free to act. She might be compromised—either willingly or because someone has control over her systems."

"But we can't just bypass the chain of command."

Torres makes a decision. "You're right. Come with me. We'll brief the Captain together, show her the evidence, and let her make the call. If she's truly compromised, we'll know soon enough."

You make your way to the command center, Torres carrying a secure data pad with all the evidence you've gathered. When you arrive, you find Captain Okafor in a heated discussion with Commander Zhang.

"—and I'm telling you, Commander, I will not authorize pre-emptive action against the Horizon until I have verified their intentions!" Okafor is saying.

Zhang's voice is cold: "By the time we verify anything, it will be too late. Special Directive Seven protocols exist for exactly this situation."

They both notice you and Torres. Okafor straightens. "Chief Torres. Engineer Chen. What is it?"

Torres steps forward. "Captain, we've discovered evidence of systematic sabotage and a hidden subroutine in our systems. Someone using your command access codes has been compromising station security for weeks."

Okafor's expression doesn't change, but you see her jaw tighten. "Show me."

Torres displays the evidence. As Okafor reviews it, Commander Zhang moves to look as well. His reaction is subtle, but you catch it—a momentary flash of recognition, quickly suppressed.

Zhang knows something about this.

**What do you do?**

You approach Chief Torres slowly, keeping your hands visible. "Explain what's going on. Now."

Torres exchanges glances with the two crew members—the man with the scar and a younger woman you don't recognize. She makes a decision.

"We're preparing an emergency evacuation. These supplies—" she gestures to the military rations "—aren't for an occupation. They're survival gear for escape pods and shuttles. We've been quietly preparing for the worst-case scenario."

"Why hide it?"

The scarred man speaks: "Because Captain Okafor won't authorize evacuation. She believes we can negotiate with whoever's on the Horizon. But some of us have seen how first contact scenarios can go wrong. We're making sure there's a Plan B."

"I'm Lieutenant Marcus Cole, formerly of the EDF  Special Operations," he continues. "I was stationed here undercover to assess the alien artifact threat. When I realized multiple factions were converging on this station, I started preparing contingencies."

The woman adds: "I'm Sarah Chen—yes, another Chen, no relation to you—communications specialist. I've been monitoring encrypted traffic from the Horizon. What they're planning isn't peaceful acquisition. It's seizure by force."

Torres looks at you intently. "We're not mutineers, Alex. We're survivors preparing for the possibility that everyone else's plans fail. Will you help us, or are you going to report us?"

**What do you do?**

You back away slowly toward the exit, your hand moving toward your communicator. "I'm calling security. Whatever you're doing is unauthorized."

Torres's expression hardens. "I'm sorry, Alex. I hoped you'd understand."

She nods to Lieutenant Cole, who moves with military precision to block your exit. Before you can react, the woman—Sarah—activates a device that creates an electromagnetic pulse, frying your communicator.

"We can't let you compromise the evacuation preparations," Torres says. "Cole, secure them. We'll have to keep Alex contained until after the Horizon docks. Then it won't matter what gets reported."

Cole approaches you. Despite his size, you manage to dodge past him and run deeper into the cargo bay, weaving between containers. You can hear them pursuing.

You spot a service ladder leading to an upper maintenance catwalk. You climb quickly, hoping to reach a communication panel or another exit. But when you reach the top, you find yourself trapped—the catwalk ends at a sealed bulkhead.

Below, Cole and the others are closing in.

**What do you do?**

"I'm not moving until you explain what's happening," you say firmly, standing your ground. "Chief Torres, I've trusted you since I came aboard. Give me a reason to keep trusting you."

Torres studies you for a long moment, then signals the others to stand down. "Fair enough. You deserve the truth." She sits on one of the containers and gestures for you to do the same.

"Three months ago, when the alien artifact was discovered, Earth Command sent me a classified directive. I was to monitor the situation and, if necessary, implement Protocol Lighthouse—a complete data purge and station evacuation if the artifact showed signs of being hostile or if outside forces attempted to seize it."

"You're Earth Command's failsafe," you realize.

"Exactly. But then things got complicated. Multiple groups infiltrated the station with different agendas. I couldn't tell who was following legitimate Earth Command orders and who was working for other interests. So I assembled my own team—people I knew I could trust."

Lieutenant Cole adds: "We're not stealing supplies. We're preparing to execute Protocol Lighthouse if Torres gives the order. That means evacuating the crew and destroying the artifact along with enough of the station to ensure no one can recover it."

"You're planning to blow up the station?"

"Only if necessary," Torres says. "If Captain Okafor can resolve this peacefully, we won't need to. But if armed operatives try to seize the artifact, or if the aliens arriving prove hostile, we need a way to protect humanity from technology we don't understand."

Chief Torres uses her access code, and the massive door to the power core chamber begins to slide open. A wave of heat washes over you—the fusion reactor runs hot, even with all its shielding.

Inside, the power core chamber is a cathedral of technology. The reactor itself sits in the center, a sphere of contained plasma generating the energy that keeps Station Osiris alive. Monitoring stations ring the chamber, their displays showing the delicate balance of power generation and distribution.

But something's wrong. You can see it immediately in the energy readings.

"Chief, look at these power draws," you say, pointing to one of the displays. "Someone's siphoning massive amounts of energy to an unlisted location. This is enough power to run a small city."

Torres examines the readings, her expression growing more concerned. "This has been going on for weeks, gradually increasing. Whatever they're powering up, it's almost at full capacity."

You trace the power conduits on the schematic. "The draw is coming from Section E-7, sublevel 3. That's—"

"Where Morrison told me he was setting up emergency backup systems," Torres finishes grimly. "Before he 'transferred.' I should have investigated more thoroughly."

Suddenly, the lights in the power core chamber flicker. An alarm sounds—not the station emergency alarm, but something specific to the power systems.

"Critical power fluctuation detected," an automated voice announces. "Core temperature rising. Initiating emergency protocols."

Torres races to the controls, but they're locked. "Someone's remotely accessing the core! They're overriding the safety systems!"

If the core goes critical, it could destroy the entire station.

**What do you do?**

Before opening the door to the power core, Torres checks the security logs to see who's accessed this area recently. Her expression darkens as she reviews the data.

"Captain Okafor was here two hours ago. Commander Zhang three hours before that. Dr. Hassan yesterday evening. Ensign Webb has been here multiple times over the past week." She shows you the log. "And look at this—there are ghost entries. Someone's been accessing the power core without logging in properly. They have admin-level codes that bypass the normal security."

"Morrison's codes?" you suggest.

"Possibly. Or someone who obtained them after he left—or disappeared, or whatever actually happened to him." Torres makes a copy of the log data. "This is evidence. If we make it through this, someone will need to answer for these unauthorized accesses."

She opens the door, and you both enter the power core chamber. Everything appears normal at first, but as you approach the control console, you notice something: a small device attached to the underside of the main terminal, nearly invisible unless you're looking for it.

"Data tap," Torres identifies immediately. "Someone's been monitoring and recording everything that happens in this chamber." She carefully removes it. "Military grade. This isn't something a civilian would have."

The device chirps softly, and Torres's eyes widen. "It's transmitting. Someone knows we found it."

Moments later, the chamber doors begin to seal. You're being locked inside.

**What do you do?**

"Let me scan for energy signatures before we go in," you suggest, pulling out your engineering tablet. The power core room should have a specific energy profile, and any deviations might indicate tampering or danger.

You run a full spectrum scan. The results are disturbing.

"Chief Torres, I'm reading three distinct energy signatures. One is the main fusion reactor—that's normal. The second is the standard power distribution network. But the third..." You show her the readings. "There's an active quantum entanglement field inside the chamber. That's technology we don't have on this station."

Torres studies the data. "Quantum entanglement communication. Instant, unhackable messaging across any distance. Someone's using our power core to run a private communication system."

"Or it's not our technology at all," you suggest. "What if it's related to the alien artifact?"

"Only one way to find out." Torres overrides the door lock, and you both enter cautiously.

Inside, you immediately locate the source of the quantum signature: a device integrated into the power distribution panel, definitely not standard station equipment. It's sleek, organic-looking, with the same faint blue glow as the alien artifact in Lab 3.

"This is alien technology," Torres whispers. "Someone brought a piece of the artifact—or something related to it—into the power core."

As you examine it, the device activates. Holographic symbols appear in the air—mathematical equations and star charts. And then a message, translated into English:

"First contact protocol initiated. Respond to establish communication parameters."

You're looking at active alien communication technology.

"Tell me," you say to Dr. Hassan, moving to stand beside him at the viewport. "I'm listening."

Hassan takes a deep breath. "The artifact we found isn't a weapon or a probe. It's a seed."

"A seed?"

"A terraforming seed, to be precise. Its purpose is to prepare planets for colonization by its creators. That ship approaching—" he points to the distant vessel "—isn't coming to make war or even to make first contact. It's coming to check on the seed's progress."

Your blood runs cold. "Progress? What has it been doing?"

"Scanning our biosphere, analyzing our atmosphere, measuring our technological level. All the data is being transmitted back to that ship. They're deciding whether Earth—and by extension, this system—is suitable for their purposes." Hassan turns to you. "If they determine we're too primitive to resist, they'll activate the seed's primary function: rewriting the molecular structure of everything on this moon to match their environmental needs. And then they'll expand to Earth."

"How do you know all this?"

"I've decoded forty percent of the artifact's data transmissions. Enough to understand its purpose, not enough to know how to stop it." He looks defeated. "I reported this to Captain Okafor yesterday. She's been trying to verify my findings before taking action. But we're running out of time."

"Why didn't she tell the crew?"

"Because the panic would be catastrophic. And because there's no escape—we can't outrun a ship that can cross interstellar distances. Our only hope is to convince them we're worth preserving, or find a way to deactivate the seed before they arrive."

"Dr. Hassan, is that ship hostile?" you ask directly, watching the distant vessel grow slowly larger.

Hassan hesitates. "Hostile is... a complex term when dealing with alien intelligence. Do they wish us harm? Probably not specifically. But do they view us as obstacles to be removed? Possibly."

"That's not reassuring."

"Welcome to xenobiology. We're trying to understand motivations of beings who may think in ways completely alien to us." He gestures to the approaching ship. "Based on the artifact's signals, I believe that vessel is automated—a Von Neumann machine programmed to expand its creators' domain. It may not even have living beings aboard."

"An automated invasion?"

"More like automated cultivation. Think of it as a farmer's tool, not a weapon. The artifact is the plow, that ship is the harvester." Hassan's voice is heavy. "The tragedy is we might be able to communicate, to negotiate, if there were actual aliens to talk to. But how do you reason with a machine following its programming?"

You watch the ship, trying to imagine its purpose. "So the Horizon is coming to seize the artifact, and that ship is coming to activate it. We're caught between two forces that both see us as obstacles."

"Precisely. Which is why some of us have been preparing a third option." Hassan looks at you carefully. "There's a group—scientists, engineers, even a few security personnel—who've been working on a plan to disable both the artifact and the alien ship's control over it. Would you like to hear it?"

"Dr. Hassan, why are you here alone instead of at your station? Shouldn't you be in Lab 3 during an emergency?"

Hassan smiles sadly. "Because Lab 3 is compromised. Three days ago, I discovered that someone on my team was reporting our research to multiple outside groups. The artifact's containment protocols, its signal patterns, even my personal theories about its creators—all being sold to the highest bidders."

"Who?"

"Dr. Reeves. The astrophysicist. He's been in contact with at least two corporate entities and a faction within Earth's military-industrial complex. They all want the artifact for different reasons, but none of them care about proper scientific protocols or the danger it represents."

Hassan gestures to the stars. "I come here because it's one of the few places on the station without surveillance. I can think. Plan. Try to figure out how to protect humanity from its own greed."

"Have you told Captain Okafor?"

"I tried. But Reeves convinced her that I was the one compromised—that I'd become obsessed with the artifact and was seeing conspiracies where none existed. She's watching me now, waiting to see if I'll prove him right or wrong."

He looks at you intently. "But you've been investigating on your own. You've seen the unauthorized equipment, the hidden operatives, the sabotage. You know something's wrong. I need someone who can vouch for me, someone Okafor will listen to."

**What do you do?**
- Agree to support Hassan with Captain Okafor → Go to Section 48
- Ask for proof of Reeves's betrayal → Go to Section 526
- Suggest confronting Reeves directly → Go to Section 529

You accept the secure communicator from Chief Ramos and slip it into your pocket. "I'll investigate Dr. Hassan. See if I can find out what he's really up to."

Ramos nods. "Be careful. If Hassan is working with the intruders, he may be dangerous. Don't confront him alone—just gather information and report back to me."

Over the next hour, you shadow Dr. Hassan through the station, maintaining a careful distance. He visits Lab 3, the communications center, and has a brief conversation with Commander Zhang in a quiet corridor. You're too far away to hear their words, but their body language suggests tension, disagreement.

Finally, Hassan goes to the hydroponics bay. You follow and watch from concealment as he meets with two people you recognize from Ramos's surveillance footage—the intruders.

But instead of a friendly meeting, you witness an argument.

"I told you, I won't help you activate the artifact prematurely," Hassan is saying. "It's too dangerous."

One of the intruders—a woman with military bearing—responds coldly: "You don't have a choice, Doctor. You've already accepted our funding. You've already shared your research. You're complicit whether you like it or not."

"Then I'll go to Captain Okafor. I'll confess everything."

"And we'll show her evidence that you've been planning to sell the artifact to the highest bidder. Who do you think she'll believe—her chief scientist caught red-handed, or respectable corporate representatives with official Earth credentials?"

Hassan looks defeated. The intruders leave, and he sits heavily among the plants, head in his hands.

You have a decision to make.

**What do you do?**
- Confront Hassan and offer to help him → Go to Section 532
- Report what you saw to Chief Ramos → Go to Section 4
- Approach Captain Okafor with the full story → Go to Section 48

**ENDING: THE VOID BETWEEN STARS**

You made it to the escape pod and launched before the station fell. Through the pod's small viewport, you watch Station Osiris explode in a brilliant flash of light as the power core destabilizes.

The artifact, the conspiracies, the approaching ships—all gone in an instant.

Your escape pod's emergency beacon is active, broadcasting your position. Earth Command will send a rescue ship, but it will take weeks to reach you. You have enough supplies to survive, barely.

As you drift through space, alone with your thoughts, you receive one final transmission—a fragment of data that somehow survived the station's destruction. It's a recording from Captain Okafor, time-stamped just before the end:

"To whoever receives this: Station Osiris has been lost, but the threat it represented has been contained. The alien artifact has been destroyed. If you're hearing this, you survived. Remember what happened here. Remember that first contact with alien intelligence requires wisdom, not greed. Requires cooperation, not competition.

"We failed those tests. We let fear and ambition tear us apart before the aliens ever arrived. Don't let humanity make the same mistake again.

"Captain Okafor, signing off."

The transmission ends. You're alone in the dark, surrounded by infinite stars, carrying humanity's first contact failure as a warning to those who might try again.

You survived, but at what cost?

**THE END - Survival Ending: Escaped but alone in space with the knowledge of humanity's failure.**

*Congratulations! You've completed one path through Station Osiris. Your journey took you through conspiracy, discovery, and difficult choices. There are many other paths and endings to discover. Will you try again and make different choices?*
