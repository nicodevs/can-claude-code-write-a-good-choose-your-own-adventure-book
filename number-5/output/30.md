You lower your pistol.

"Helena, wait." Your voice is steady, calm. The voice you used in a hundred boardrooms, a thousand negotiations. "Look at the data. Look at what humanity has survived. Ice ages. Plagues. World wars. We adapt. We survive. That's what we do."

Marcus keeps his rifle trained on her, but he doesn't fire. He's giving you this chance.

Vex tilts her head, curious. Her finger hovers over the button.

"Your virus isn't evolution," you continue, stepping closer. "It's extinction. You're not creating something new. You're destroying everything that makes us human. Our creativity. Our compassion. Our capacity to love."

For a moment, something flickers in her eyes. Doubt. Hesitation. The ghost of whoever she was before she became this.

"I was human once," she says quietly. "I believed in all those things. And then I watched humanity tear itself apart over resources, over ideology, over nothing at all. We're a cancer on this planet."

"Then let us prove you wrong." You hold up the case of blue vials. "This cure works. We can end the infection. Rebuild. Be better."

She stares at the vials. At you. At the screens showing cities in flames.

Then she smiles. Cold. Final.

"You always were naive."

She presses the button.

BANG!

Marcus's shot takes her through the shoulder, spinning her around, but it's too late. The consoles flash red. Alarms blare. On every screen, you watch ventilation systems activate across the country. Red mist floods into subway tunnels, office buildings, safe zones. Everywhere. All at once.

You stand frozen as the world ends on a dozen monitors.

Your cure works perfectly on the original strain. You tested it yourself. But Z-Virus 2.0 is something else entirely. Permanent. Irreversible. Unstoppable.

Humanity doesn't die that day. It becomes something else. Something less.

And you get to watch it happen.

**THE END**
