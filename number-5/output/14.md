"Prove it works first," you say. "Then we go after her."

Marcus hesitates. You can see the soldier in him wanting to strike at the source, end this now. But he nods. "Your call."

You radio Colonel Rivera on the emergency military frequency. Static crackles, then a voice, rough with exhaustion.

"Who is this?"

"My name doesn't matter. I'm the CEO of NanoGenix. I have a working cure for the Z-Virus. Bring infected subjects to your quarantine zone. I can prove it."

Silence. Then a harsh laugh. "Lady, I've heard a hundred crackpots claim they have cures. What makes you different?"

"Nothing. Except I'm telling the truth."

More silence. You can almost hear him weighing the odds, calculating the risk of hope against the certainty of despair.

"Fine," he says finally. "Quarantine Zone Seven. One hour."

You arrive under heavy escort, guns trained on you the entire way. Soldiers watch with hollow eyes as you enter the containment area. Twelve infected subjects strain against restraints, moaning, snapping their teeth. The smell of rot fills the air.

Rivera stands with his arms crossed. "This better not be a waste of my time."

You load the first syringe. Step forward. Inject.

One minute passes. Two. Then, slowly, the milky film over the infected man's eyes begins to clear. He blinks. His breathing steadies. He looks around, confused, terrified, but human.

"Where am I?" he rasps. "What happened?"

You move down the line. Subject after subject. Within minutes, all twelve are awake, alive, cured. Some weep. Some just stare.

Rivera's jaw hangs open. "It works."

"Mass production takes time," you tell him. "But I can synthesize more. Enough for every safe zone on the eastern seaboard."

He mobilizes immediately. Helicopters. Supply runs. Distribution networks. Your cure spreads through military channels like wildfire. Thousands of infected are saved in the first twenty-four hours.

But while you were proving your miracle, Vex was watching.

Three days later, the sky darkens with drones. The enhanced strain, Z-Virus 2.0, rains down on every major city you haven't reached. It spreads faster than you can cure. For every person you save, ten more fall.

You did everything right. You saved thousands. Maybe tens of thousands.

But the world still falls.

In the end, you and Marcus establish an enclave in the mountains. A protected community of survivors, immune to 2.0 thanks to the original cure. Humanity endures. In pockets. In fragments. In the quiet spaces between the hordes.

Not the victory you hoped for. But not defeat either.

Just survival.

**THE END**
