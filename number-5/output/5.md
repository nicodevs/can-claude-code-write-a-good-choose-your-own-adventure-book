You wrench the wheel east, plunging into the maze of narrow streets between warehouses. The buildings loom tall and windowless on either side, blocking out the chaos of downtown. Here the screams are distant. Muffled.

For the first time since Derek lunged at you in that boardroom, you can breathe.

The van rumbles past loading docks and chain-link fences. A few infected wander between shipping containers, but they're slow, scattered. You weave around them easily. The GPS shows you're making good time. Maybe this will actually work.

Then you see the barricade.

Two box trucks parked nose-to-nose across the street, blocking the only route forward. Sandbags. Wooden pallets. Someone has been busy. But this isn't military. No uniforms, no insignia. Just desperate people who've carved out a tiny pocket of safety in a world gone mad.

You slow the van to a stop.

A woman emerges from behind the sandbags. Forties, maybe. Hard eyes. Shotgun raised and pointed directly at your windshield.

"Stop there!" she calls out. "We're not letting anyone infected through."

You roll down the window, hands visible. "I'm not infected. I'm a scientist. I'm trying to reach my lab. We can make a cure."

She doesn't lower the gun. "Everyone says they're immune. Special. Whatever." She spits on the pavement. "Show me a bite and you're not getting through."

"I'm clean. Check me if you want."

She does. A quick visual inspection while two men with rifles keep you covered. No bites. No scratches. She seems almost disappointed.

"Fine. You're clean. But clean don't buy passage." She gestures at the van. "What you got? Food? Weapons? Medicine?"

You check the back. Empty. Nothing but old delivery receipts and a moldy blanket.

"I've got nothing," you admit. "But the cure, once I synthesize it, I can come back. I can help all of you."

"Promises don't stop the dead from walking." She raises the shotgun again, barrel aimed at your chest. "Turn around or we shoot."

Behind you, a shuffling sound. You glance in the side mirror. Infected. A dozen of them, maybe more, shambling out from between the warehouses. They've found you. And they're cutting off your retreat.

The woman with the shotgun hasn't seen them yet. Her eyes are locked on you.
