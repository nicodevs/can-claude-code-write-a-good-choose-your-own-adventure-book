You snatch the drive from the terminal and shove it into your pocket.

"Got it. Let's go!"

Marcus fires three more rounds through the doorway, buying you precious seconds. You bolt past him into the flooded corridor. Water splashes around your ankles as you run, alarms still screaming, red emergency lights painting everything the color of blood.

A mercenary rounds the corner ahead. Marcus doesn't break stride. Two shots. The man drops.

You hit the stairwell door together and plunge downward. Footsteps thunder above you. Shouts echo off the concrete walls. They're following, but you have a head start.

Ground floor. Out through a service exit. Into the chaos of the dying city.

"My lab's three miles east," you pant, sucking air into burning lungs. "Underground. Beneath the old pharmaceutical building on Tenth."

Marcus nods, scanning the street. "Subway tunnels will get us close. Surface is too hot."

He's right. The streets are a nightmare of crashed cars, wandering infected, and distant gunfire. Every block above ground is a death sentence waiting to happen.

You find a subway entrance two blocks away, the stairs cracked and buckled, emergency lights flickering weakly within. Marcus clicks on his flashlight. The beam cuts through the darkness, revealing graffiti-covered walls and scattered debris.

You descend.

The smell hits you first. Rot. Decay. Something worse. The tracks are littered with bodies, some still, some twitching. Distant moans echo through the tunnels, impossible to locate. Could be fifty meters away. Could be five.

"Stay close," Marcus whispers. "Stay quiet."

Ahead, the tunnel branches. A faded sign points left toward the Civic Center station. Your lab is that direction. But the right tunnel leads to an underground shopping district, brighter, more open. Easier to see what's coming.

The moaning grows louder.
