"I need to cross the city," you say. "Get to NanoGenix's underground lab."

Marcus stares at you like you just suggested a leisurely stroll through a minefield. "You want to cross the city? Suicide. Have you looked outside?"

"There's a cure. Or there can be." You pull out your phone, show him Sarah's message. "Our nanotech platform. We designed it to target any pathogen. If I can get to the lab, get to the equipment, I can synthesize something that stops this."

His jaw tightens. Something shifts in his eyes.

"Sarah Chen sent that?"

You nod. "She went dark right after. I don't know if she made it."

Marcus is quiet for a moment. Then he turns and walks deeper into the building, gesturing for you to follow. You pass through a reinforced door into what looks like a small armory. Weapons racks line the walls. Tactical gear hangs from hooks. Monitors display feeds from cameras across the city, showing nothing but chaos and death.

"I've got intel," he says, grabbing an assault rifle from the rack. "GeneSys did this. A scientist named Dr. Helena Vex. She engineered the virus. Some twisted population control experiment." He checks the rifle's magazine, slaps it back in. "She's holed up in their downtown facility with a private army of mercenaries. Word is she's working on version 2.0. Permanent infection. No cure possible."

Your blood runs cold. "We have to stop her."

"You get me to that cure, I'll get you past anything." He tosses you a pistol and a set of body armor. You catch them clumsily, the weight unfamiliar in your hands. "Suit up. We hit GeneSys first. Their research data will tell us exactly what we're dealing with."

You strap on the armor, checking the pistol the way you've seen in movies. It'll have to do.

"GeneSys has military-grade security," Marcus continues. "Biometric locks, armed guards, the works. We need an angle."

You remember something. Derek's phone. Your CFO. You grabbed it reflexively when you fled the boardroom. Derek had access to everything at GeneSys. Part of a joint venture you never fully understood. His credentials might still work.

Or you could go simple. Fire alarms evacuate buildings. Panic clears hallways. Slip in during the chaos.
