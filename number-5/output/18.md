"Parking garage," Marcus says. "Service elevator. I saw it on the blueprints."

You follow him through the red-lit corridors, past abandoned workstations and overturned chairs. The stairs are faster than waiting for the main elevator. Six flights down, your legs burn, but fear keeps you moving.

The service elevator waits at the end of a maintenance hallway. Marcus hits the button. The doors grind open. You descend into darkness.

The parking garage is silent. Empty cars sit in neat rows, their owners long gone or long dead. Your phone's flashlight cuts a narrow beam through the black. Marcus leads you to a fire door in the far corner.

"Subway maintenance tunnels," he says. "Connects to the old transit system. Should get us clear."

The tunnels are a maze of rusted pipes and dripping water. You navigate by phone light, stepping over debris, ducking under low ceilings. Twice you hear shuffling in the dark and freeze, holding your breath. But nothing comes.

You emerge through a grate near the lab district. Daylight stings your eyes.

Then your phone buzzes. A message from Colonel Rivera: SAFE ZONES FAILING. NEED CURE NOW.

You're behind schedule. Hours lost in the underground labyrinth while the world collapsed above.

You reach NanoGenix's hidden lab. Sarah isn't there. The equipment works. You synthesize the cure, batch after batch, as fast as the machines allow.

But you're too late.

Across the city, Dr. Vex activates Z-Virus 2.0. You hear it happen. A new wave of screams rolling across the skyline. The permanent strain spreading faster than any cure could stop.

You save some. A few hundred. Maybe a thousand. You establish a protected zone around the lab, walls manned by survivors, cure distributed to those who made it.

But most of humanity transforms that night. The world you knew ends.

You stand on the roof at dawn, watching smoke rise from a city that will never recover. Marcus joins you, says nothing.

You survived. But this isn't victory. This is what's left.

**THE END**
