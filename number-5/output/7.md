The footsteps are getting closer. You don't have time to think. You just move.

You race between desks, scanning keyboards, chairs, the floor. Nothing. A woman lies slumped over her workstation near the window. Her lanyard is still around her neck, but the card slot is empty.

Come on. Come on!

You rip open desk drawers. Staplers. Post-its. A half-eaten granola bar. No keycard.

The moaning grows louder. Shadows flicker in the hallway. They're almost here.

Then you see it. A glint of plastic beneath a fallen chair. You dive, scraping your knees on carpet, and close your fingers around it. A keycard, still warm from someone's pocket.

You sprint for the exit. Swipe.

The light turns green.

The door flies open to a stairwell. You don't wait. You take the stairs three at a time, spiraling down, down, down. Twelve floors blur past. Your lungs burn. Your legs scream. But you don't stop.

Ground floor.

You burst through the stairwell door into the lobby.

Your heart sinks.

The lobby is crawling with infected. Dozens of them. Maybe more. They mill between overturned furniture and shattered glass, bumping into each other like sleepwalkers caught in some horrible dream.

Too many to fight. Way too many.

But there. To your left. A sign for the parking garage.

You don't hesitate. You run.

Heads turn. Moans rise. The horde gives chase.

You slam through the garage door and sprint down the ramp. Concrete pillars blur past. Your footsteps echo off the low ceiling. Behind you, the infected pour through the doorway like water through a burst dam.

Then you see it. A motorcycle, leaning against a pillar. Keys dangling from the ignition.

You throw your leg over, twist the key, and the engine roars to life.

You gun it.

The exit ramp climbs ahead. Sunlight spills through the opening. You lean low, accelerating, and the infected swipe at empty air as you rocket past them.

You burst out onto the street.

Freedom.

The wind tears at your ruined suit as you weave through abandoned cars and stumbling corpses. You're alive. Against all odds, you're alive.

But you're alone. No allies. No intel about where this outbreak came from. Just you, a stolen motorcycle, and the road stretching ahead toward NanoGenix's underground lab.

Sarah's message said the lab was your only chance. But it's across town, through miles of infested streets. And you know nothing about what you're facing.
