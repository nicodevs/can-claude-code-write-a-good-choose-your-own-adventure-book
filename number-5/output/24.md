Marcus turns toward the weapons rack on the far wall. Rifles. Shotguns. Tactical gear arranged with military precision.

His back is to you.

You don't hesitate. You grab the heavy tactical lamp from the table beside you and swing hard.

The crack of metal against skull is sickening. Marcus drops like a puppet with cut strings, crumpling to the concrete floor. You stand there, breathing hard, the lamp still raised. Then you kneel and press two fingers to his neck.

A pulse. He's alive. Just unconscious.

Good enough.

You strip him of everything useful. His rifle. Six magazines of ammunition. A combat knife. And a manila folder marked OUTBREAK INTEL in red letters.

You flip it open. Satellite photos. Internal memos. A name circled multiple times: DR. HELENA VEX, CHIEF SCIENTIST, GENESYS. So the rumors were true. GeneSys engineered this nightmare.

You leave Marcus on the cold floor and slip out into the night.

Hours later, exhausted and alone, you reach the GeneSys compound. The building looms against the smoke-choked sky. You scout the perimeter, looking for an entry point.

But without Marcus's military training, you don't notice the infrared tripwire.

Alarms shriek. Floodlights snap on.

You fight hard. You drop two mercenaries before they overwhelm you, driving you to your knees, zip-tying your wrists behind your back.

They drag you through sterile corridors to a pristine laboratory. Dr. Helena Vex stands waiting, lab coat immaculate, a syringe filled with something dark in her hand.

"Perfect timing," she says, her smile cold as a scalpel. "I need test subjects for 2.0."

The needle slides into your neck.

The world goes red.

**THE END**
