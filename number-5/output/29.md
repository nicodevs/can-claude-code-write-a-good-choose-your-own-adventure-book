You dart to the refrigeration unit and pull open the frosted glass door. The vials gleam under the emergency lights, each one labeled with crisp black text: Z-VIRUS ACTIVE. You grab a handful and shove them into your jacket pocket.

"For study," you say when Marcus gives you a look. "We need to understand what we're fighting."

His jaw tightens. He doesn't argue, but his eyes tell you everything.

You both bolt from the lab, splashing through the flooded corridors toward the service stairwell. Marcus clears corners while you follow, the vials clinking softly against each other with every step. Down through the parking garage. Into the subway tunnels beneath the city.

The darkness swallows you whole. Water drips from cracked pipes. Your flashlight cuts a weak beam through the black. You move fast, too fast, desperate to reach the NanoGenix lab before Vex releases 2.0.

Your foot catches on a rail.

You pitch forward.

CRASH.

The vials shatter against the concrete. Cold liquid splashes across your hands, your neck, seeping through your torn shirt to the skin beneath. You scramble to your feet, but you can already feel it. A burning sensation spreading from every point of contact.

"No," you whisper. "No, no, no."

Marcus backs away, rifle rising. His face is stone.

Within seconds, your veins darken to black beneath your skin. Your thoughts scatter, dissolving into static. Hunger. You feel hunger now, raw and overwhelming. You try to speak his name, but only a moan escapes your lips.

"I'm sorry," Marcus says quietly. Then, mercifully, quickly, he pulls the trigger.

He reaches the lab alone. But the nanotech assembler requires your biometrics. Your codes. Your expertise.

Hubris killed you. And the world with it.

**THE END**
