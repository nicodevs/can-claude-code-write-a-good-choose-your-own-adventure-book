You ditch the motorcycle at the 14th Street entrance and descend into darkness.

The subway reeks of rot and stagnant water. Your phone's flashlight carves a weak cone through the blackness. You move fast, staying low, keeping your footsteps soft. The tunnels echo with distant moans, shuffling feet, the occasional splash of something wading through the flooded tracks.

You see them sometimes. Gray shapes stumbling through the darkness, heads turning toward sounds that aren't you. You freeze. You wait. You move again.

Hours pass. Your battery drains to twelve percent, then eight. You navigate by memory now, counting stations, feeling the curve of the tunnels.

Finally, you reach the unmarked access door. Your palm finds the scanner.

BEEP. Green light. The lock disengages.

Inside, the lab is pristine. Emergency power hums. Sarah's nanotech assembler sits on the central workstation, waiting. No sign of Sarah herself.

You don't have time to mourn. You don't have time to wonder. You get to work.

Forty minutes. The assembler whirs and clicks. You watch the progress bar crawl forward while the world burns above you.

Success.

Six vials of glowing blue liquid. The cure. You did it.

You inject yourself first. The nanotech floods your bloodstream, a cool tingling sensation spreading through your veins. If you get bitten now, you'll survive.

But as you stand there holding humanity's salvation, reality settles in. No distribution network. No military contacts. No idea where Dr. Vex is or what she's planning. You heard rumors about Z-Virus 2.0, something worse, something permanent. You have no way to stop it.

Over the following weeks, you cure a small group of survivors who find their way to your lab. Seventeen people. You fortify the tunnels. You scavenge. You survive.

Above ground, the enhanced virus spreads. Cities fall silent. The world you knew ends.

You're alive. Your people are alive. But in the end, all you saved was a bunker.

**THE END**
