"Simple," Marcus says with a grim smile. "I like it."

You circle the GeneSys tower, keeping to the shadows. The building rises twelve stories of steel and glass, crawling with armed guards at every entrance. Through the lobby windows, you spot mercenaries in tactical gear, assault rifles ready. This place is locked down tight.

But every building has a weak point.

You find the fire alarm access panel in an alley around back. A quick smash with the butt of your pistol, and you're staring at wires. Red one. Has to be the red one.

You pull it.

WAAAAH. WAAAAH. WAAAAH.

The sirens are deafening. Strobe lights flash across every floor. You press yourself against the wall and wait.

It takes less than a minute. The doors burst open. Mercenaries pour out first, followed by panicked lab techs in white coats. They run straight into the street.

Straight into the infected.

Screams tear through the night. The horde descends on them, gray hands grabbing, teeth finding flesh. You try not to watch. This was your plan. These deaths are on you.

"Move," Marcus hisses.

You slip through a side door while chaos consumes the front entrance. The building is nearly empty now. Emergency lighting casts everything in dim red. Your footsteps echo through abandoned corridors.

Twelfth floor. Vex's private lab.

The door stands open, abandoned mid-evacuation. Equipment hums. Terminals glow with data. You rush to the nearest computer and jam in a flash drive.

Download progress: 15%... 34%... 67%...

"Got it," you breathe. Z-Virus 2.0 schematics. Bunker coordinates. Everything.

Then Marcus taps your shoulder. "Look."

Through the window, you see them. Thousands of infected, drawn by the alarm, surrounding the building in a writhing sea of gray flesh. The horde you created. The horde that's now trapped you on the twelfth floor with no way down.
