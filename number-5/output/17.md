No time to search. You raise the fire extinguisher and slam it into the door beside the lock.

BANG!

The metal dents. The door shudders but holds.

You swing again. And again. Each impact echoes through the building like a dinner bell.

The lock cracks. One more hit should do it. You pull back for another swing.

That's when you hear them. Not footsteps anymore. A wave of shuffling, moaning bodies converging from every direction. The stairwell. The elevator bank. The cubicle farm behind you. They pour through doorways like water through a broken dam.

You swing wildly. The extinguisher connects with a jaw, sends one of them stumbling backward. But two more take its place. Three. Five. A dozen gray faces with milky eyes, all focused on you.

Something grabs your ankle. You kick free, spin, swing. The extinguisher grows heavy in your trembling arms.

Teeth sink into your shoulder.

You scream. Hot pain floods through you as you feel flesh tear away. You try to keep fighting, but hands are pulling you down now, too many hands, dragging you to the carpet.

The fire extinguisher rolls away across the floor. Useless.

Your vision blurs. The moaning fills your ears like static. Your last coherent thought is bitter regret. The lab was so close. Sarah's cure platform, the nanotech that could have stopped all of this. You were ten floors away from saving the world.

Now you'll never save anyone.

The infection spreads through your veins like fire. Your thoughts scatter, dissolve, disappear.

You become one of them.

**THE END**
