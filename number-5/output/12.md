You grab an assault rifle from the weapons locker, feeling its weight in your hands. Heavier than you expected. Marcus nods approvingly. "Stay behind me. Shoot anything that moves."

You take the stairwell, climbing fast. Floor three. The four mercs turn at the sound of your footsteps. Marcus drops two before they can raise their weapons. You squeeze the trigger, bullets spraying wide, and somehow hit a third. The fourth dives behind a pillar, radioing for backup.

"Move!" Marcus shouts.

You storm upward, nine more floors of burning lungs and pounding heart. When you burst onto the twelfth floor, the mercenaries are waiting.

Muzzle flashes light up the corridor. You drop behind a desk, firing back. Two more hostiles fall. But these aren't street thugs. They're professionals. Disciplined. Coordinated.

A flashbang clatters across the floor.

BANG.

White light sears your vision. Your ears ring. You stumble forward, blind, and feel bullets punch into your chest. The body armor catches some. Not enough. Pain explodes through your ribs. Something warm and wet spreads across your stomach.

You collapse. Blood pools beneath you, dark and fast.

Marcus grabs your collar and drags you toward the stairwell. "Stay with me!"

"The lab..." you wheeze. "Sarah..."

He presses his hands against your wounds, but you both know. The blood is coming too fast. Arterial. Nothing stops arterial.

Three floors down, in a cold concrete stairwell, your vision fades to black. The last thing you see is Marcus's face, streaked with your blood, his eyes already calculating his next move.

He escapes. But without your biometric access codes, the cure lab stays sealed forever. Humanity falls to Z-Virus 2.0, and Dr. Vex gets her evolutionary nightmare.

All because you thought a CEO could be a soldier.

**THE END**
