"Standard protocol," you say. "No shortcuts. Not with this."

Marcus nods. "Good call."

You input Sarah's synthesis protocols, your fingers steady despite everything. The assembler responds immediately, its systems humming to life with a low, resonant thrum that vibrates through the floor. Inside the transparent chamber, millions of microscopic nanobots begin their intricate dance, suspended in a pale blue solution that glows faintly under the UV lights.

Forty minutes. You pace. Marcus takes position by the entrance, shotgun resting across his knees, eyes fixed on the corridor beyond.

While you wait, you pull out the drive from GeneSys and plug it into Sarah's workstation. The encrypted files begin to decrypt, line after line of data scrolling across the screen. Research logs. Deployment schedules. And there, buried in the metadata, coordinates.

Bunker Omega. Fifteen miles west, deep in the foothills. Vex's fallback position.

But that's not the worst of it.

The files reveal her timeline. Z-Virus 2.0. Permanent infection. Irreversible neurological damage. No cure possible once deployed. And she's planning to release it in six hours, airborne dispersal over every major population center on the eastern seaboard.

"We can't let her do that," Marcus says, reading over your shoulder. His voice is quiet, cold.

The assembler chimes.

You turn. Inside the chamber, rows of vials have filled with glowing blue liquid. The cure. Actual, viable, tested cure. You open the chamber and begin loading them into a thermal carrying case. Twenty doses. Enough to prove the concept. Enough to start turning the tide.

Marcus pulls up a tactical map on the secondary display. Red dots mark military safe zones. A single blue marker pulses fifteen miles west.

"Two options," he says. "We hit her bunker now, before she releases 2.0. Cut off the head. Or we distribute this cure first, get it to Colonel Rivera's safe zones, prove it works. Build an army, then go after Vex."

You stare at the map. At the vials in your hands. At the clock counting down toward extinction.
