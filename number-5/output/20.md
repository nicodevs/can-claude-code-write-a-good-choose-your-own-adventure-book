You slam the accelerator to the floor.

The soldier's eyes go wide. He dives left. His partner opens fire.

CRACK. CRACK. CRACK.

The windshield spiderwebs. You duck low, steering blind, and hit the barrier at sixty miles per hour. Wood and sandbags explode around you. Something heavy bounces off the hood. The van lurches, tips onto two wheels, then crashes back down with a bone-rattling impact.

But you're through.

Behind you, shouts. More gunfire. Bullets ping off the van's rear doors, punching dents in the metal. You swerve down a side street, then another, putting buildings between you and the checkpoint. The shooting fades. They're not following. Too busy with the horde you just led straight to their barricade.

You check your mirror. Nothing but empty streets and flickering streetlights.

Three blocks later, you recognize the building. Reinforced windows. Security cameras on every corner. A small sign by the door: KANE SECURITY CONSULTING.

Marcus.

You screech to a halt and stumble out of the van. Your legs are shaking. Blood trickles down your forehead from somewhere. The security door is solid steel, three inches thick at least, with a camera mounted above it.

You pound on the metal. "Marcus! It's me! Open up!"

The camera swivels, its red eye locking onto your face.

Static crackles. Then a familiar voice, rough and surprised.

"Thought you were dead."

The door buzzes. You shove it open and slip inside just as a distant moan echoes down the street. The infected are spreading. Nowhere is safe for long.

Marcus meets you in the corridor, tactical vest already on, a shotgun in his hands. He looks you over. Torn suit. Blood. Wild eyes.

"You look like hell," he says. "What's the play?"
