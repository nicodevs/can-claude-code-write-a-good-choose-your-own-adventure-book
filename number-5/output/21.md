Something in you snaps. You're done negotiating, done begging, done being polite while the world burns around you. You came here to save humanity. These people are just obstacles.

You floor it.

The van's engine roars as you slam the accelerator down. The woman with the shotgun barely has time to widen her eyes before you're hurtling toward the gap between the two trucks.

The survivors open fire.

The first bullet punches through your windshield, spiderwebbing the glass. The second follows a heartbeat later. Then another. And another. The windshield disintegrates into a thousand glittering fragments.

White-hot pain explodes in your shoulder. You scream, jerking the wheel involuntarily. Another round catches you in the chest, punching through your ribcage like a fist. Your hands go slack on the steering wheel.

The van clips the edge of the truck on your left. The impact sends you spinning. For one endless moment you're airborne, the world rotating outside your shattered windows. Sky. Ground. Sky. Ground.

Then you hit something solid, and everything becomes fire and twisted metal.

You lie in the wreckage, gasoline soaking into your ruined suit. Through fading vision, you see the survivors approach cautiously, weapons raised. The woman with the shotgun peers down at you, shaking her head.

"Idiot," she says.

In your pocket, your phone buzzes one final time. Sarah's message glows on the cracked screen: "Did you make it?"

No one will ever answer.

**THE END**
