You don't hesitate. You lunge for the terminal.

"Marcus, NOW!"

He tackles Vex at the same moment, rifle clattering to the floor as they crash against the console. She screams, clawing at his face, but Marcus has fifty pounds of muscle on her and a decade of combat training. He pins her arms, wrenching the vial from her grip.

Your fingers fly across the keyboard. Derek's credentials still work. Emergency override, executive authority. You navigate through GeneSys's system architecture, searching for what you need. And there it is. NanoGenix's emergency drone network. Hundreds of autonomous dispersal units stored at secure facilities around the world. Your backup plan. Sarah's backup plan. A failsafe you prayed you'd never need.

You upload the cure formula directly into the network's central hub. The drones will synthesize it on-site, then deploy automatically. Global coverage in under six hours.

Vex thrashes beneath Marcus. "You can't stop evolution! Humanity is a disease!"

"Then we're the antibiotics," you mutter.

You trigger a system purge on her release mechanism. Error codes cascade across the screens. The ventilation network locks down, city by city. And then Vex's crimson vial slips from Marcus's grip, tumbling through the air.

Time slows. You watch it fall.

Your boot comes down hard.

CRUNCH.

Red liquid sizzles harmlessly against the concrete floor, already breaking down on contact with open air. Without the pressurized dispersal system, Z-Virus 2.0 is nothing. Just a puddle of failed ambition.

The screens flicker. New feeds appear. Launch confirmations from Tokyo. São Paulo. Berlin. London. Los Angeles. Your drones are airborne, dispersing the cure across every major population center on the planet.

Vex goes still beneath Marcus. Her eyes are fixed on the screens, watching her life's work crumble. "No," she whispers. "No, no, no..."

But it's already over.

Within days, the infection begins to recede. The mindless hordes slow, stumble, collapse. Some recover entirely. Others don't. But the spread stops. The nightmare ends.

Your startup becomes humanity's lifeline. NanoGenix facilities around the world work around the clock, producing cure after cure. Governments beg for your help. Scientists study your nanotech platform. The world begins to rebuild.

And in a makeshift headquarters three months later, Marcus finds you reviewing distribution reports. He's traded his tactical vest for a security consultant's badge, but the grin is the same.

"Not bad," he says, clapping you on the shoulder. "Not bad at all. For a CEO."

You lean back in your chair and allow yourself, for the first time since that boardroom presentation, to smile.

**THE END**
