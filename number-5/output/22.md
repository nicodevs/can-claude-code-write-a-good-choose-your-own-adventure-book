"Supply closet," Marcus says, already moving. "Saw climbing gear on the fifth floor during our sweep."

You spend the next hour scavenging the building. Rope. Carabiners. Harnesses clearly meant for window washers, not tactical escapes. It'll have to do.

By the time you've assembled everything, dusk bleeds across the sky. The horde still circles below, thousands of them, but their movements have slowed. They cluster near the lobby entrance, drawn by something you can't see. The far side of the building is almost clear.

"Nightfall," Marcus says. "We go dark. No lights, no sounds. Straight down, then we vanish."

You wait. Hours crawl past. The sun sinks. Shadows swallow the city.

Finally, Marcus nods.

You crack a window on the building's western face and clip into the harness. The wind is cold against your face as you lower yourself over the edge, feet braced against glass and steel. Below, the infected shuffle aimlessly, unaware of the shadows descending above them.

Hand over hand. Floor by floor. Your arms burn. Your palms are raw. But you don't make a sound.

You reach the ground. Marcus lands beside you seconds later. Together, you slip into an alley and disappear.

It isn't until you're blocks away that you check your phone. Seventeen missed messages from Colonel Rivera.

You read them in growing horror.

VEX RELEASED SOMETHING NEW.

IT'S SPREADING FAST.

TOO LATE?

Z-Virus 2.0. Already in the population. Already mutating beyond anything your cure could target.

You reach NanoGenix's underground lab by dawn. Sarah's equipment still works. You synthesize the cure, inject the first batch into volunteers from protected enclaves. It works on the original strain. Perfectly.

But 2.0 is different. Faster. Adaptive. Unstoppable.

You save thousands. Maybe tens of thousands. Survivors in bunkers and safe zones and quarantine camps, cleared of infection and given a second chance.

But outside those walls, the world belongs to the dead now.

Partial victory. Hollow consolation.

You did everything right. You just didn't do it fast enough.

**THE END**
