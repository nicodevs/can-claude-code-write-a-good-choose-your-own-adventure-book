The GeneSys tower rises against the blood-red sky like a tombstone. No lights in the windows except for the flicker of emergency generators on a handful of floors. The apocalypse hasn't even spared the company that started it.

You and Marcus crouch behind an overturned taxi across the street. Bodies litter the plaza. Some still twitch. You try not to look at them.

"Ready?" Marcus asks.

You pull out Derek's phone. Your dead CFO. The man who lunged at you in the boardroom just hours ago. His face unlock still works. His credentials are still active. Gold.

You both sprint across the plaza, weaving between abandoned cars. Marcus covers the angles while you reach the security terminal beside the main entrance. Your fingers fly across the screen, inputting Derek's executive override codes.

The system accepts them. A green light blinks. The heavy glass doors slide open with a soft hiss.

Inside, the lobby is dark and silent. Emergency lights cast long red shadows across the marble floor. Marcus moves first, sweeping corners with his rifle. You follow close behind.

"Cameras," you whisper, pointing to a security station.

You access the feed. Interior views flicker across the monitors. Floors one and two look clear. But floor three shows movement. Four mercenaries in tactical gear, patrolling the stairwell entrance. And floor twelve, Vex's laboratory, shows another eight hostiles guarding the main corridor. All armed with assault rifles.

"Fourteen mercs between us and the target," Marcus murmurs. "Could be worse."

"Could be better."

He grins, but there's no humor in it. "We go loud or ghost mode? Stairwell is clear right now, but it'll take time. Elevator's faster, but that ding when the doors open might as well be a dinner bell."

You study the building schematic on the screen. There's a third option. The fire suppression system runs through the entire building. You could flood the twelfth floor with halon gas. Non-lethal to humans in small doses, but disorienting. It would create chaos, scatter the guards, give you a window.

Or you could do this the old-fashioned way. There's a weapons locker in the security station. You can see the assault rifles through the mesh. Grab one, fight through. Simple. Violent. Effective.

Marcus watches you, waiting for the call.
