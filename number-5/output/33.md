"Fire suppression," you say. "Floor twelve. Hit it."

Your fingers dance across the security console, navigating through Derek's executive access. You find the environmental controls, then the floor-specific triggers. One button. You hesitate for a fraction of a second, then press it.

Somewhere above you, a siren begins to wail.

On the monitors, you watch chaos erupt. Sprinklers burst to life on the twelfth floor, spraying sheets of water across the corridors. The mercenaries scatter, some covering their weapons, others shouting into radios. Red emergency lights strobe through the spray. It's beautiful. It's perfect.

"Go," Marcus says.

You both hit the stairwell at a dead sprint. Your footsteps echo off concrete walls as you climb, floor after floor, legs burning. Marcus takes the steps three at a time, rifle up, moving like this is just another Tuesday. You struggle to keep pace.

Twelfth floor.

Marcus kicks through the stairwell door. Water cascades over you both, soaking through your clothes in seconds. Alarms blare. The corridor is a blur of motion and spray. Two mercenaries stumble past, completely disoriented, and Marcus drops them both with the butt of his rifle before they even register your presence.

Up ahead, a door marked LABORATORY 12-A. Vex's lab.

You slip inside, dripping, heart pounding.

The lab glows with the light of a dozen terminals. Banks of servers hum along one wall. Refrigeration units line another, their contents hidden behind frosted glass. But what catches your eye are the file folders stacked on the central workstation. Physical folders. Handwritten labels.

Z-VIRUS 2.0. BUNKER OMEGA.

"Jackpot," you breathe.

You grab a portable drive from your pocket and jam it into the nearest terminal. Files begin downloading. Research data. Deployment schedules. A map. Coordinates for something called Bunker Omega, deep in the mountains north of the city.

Behind you, the door bursts open. Footsteps splash through the flooded corridor.

"We've got company," Marcus growls. "Finish up. Now."

You glance at the screen. Ninety percent. Ninety-five. Complete.

You yank the drive free. But there's more. The refrigeration unit contains rows of vials, neatly labeled. Z-Virus samples. The actual pathogen. You could take them. Study them alongside your cure data. Dangerous, but potentially invaluable.

Or you could focus on what you came for. The encrypted files have everything. Bunker coordinates. Research data. Enough to stop Vex if you can reach your lab in time.

Marcus fires two shots through the doorway.

"Make a choice!"
