You override Sarah's protocols. Your fingers fly across the interface, cranking up the assembler output. More cure, faster. Time is everything.

"What are you doing?" Marcus yells from across the lab.

The machine groans. Metal shudders. Warning lights flash red across every screen.

THERMAL OVERLOAD. CONTAINMENT BREACH IMMINENT.

You don't stop. Can't stop. Just a few more seconds and you'll have enough cure to save thousands.

The assembler explodes.

A shower of sparks and chemicals erupts from the core. You're thrown backward, slamming into a workstation. Glass shatters. Alarms scream. Nanobots swarm free, haywire, eating through the containment field like acid through paper.

"Get out!" Marcus drags you toward the exit as toxic smoke fills the lab. Your eyes burn. Your lungs seize. You stumble through the emergency door and collapse on the abandoned platform, coughing, gasping.

Behind you, the facility burns. Everything. Sarah's research. The assembler. The cure.

Gone.

You survive. You make it out of the city. You even hear the news broadcasts over the following weeks.

The outbreak spreads. Unchecked. Unstoppable.

Vex wins.

Humanity transforms into something monstrous. Cities fall silent. Civilization crumbles. And you live with the knowledge that you had the cure in your hands. That you destroyed it yourself. That your impatience, your arrogance, doomed the world.

You survive, but survival isn't living. Not anymore.

**THE END**
