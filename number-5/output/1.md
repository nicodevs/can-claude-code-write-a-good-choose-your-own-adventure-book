"And as you can see," you say, clicking to the next slide, "our nanotech platform can target any pathogen with ninety-eight percent efficacy."

The investors nod. Hartwell from Meridian Capital is already reaching for his checkbook. This is it. The Series B that will change everything.

Then the screaming starts.

At first you think it's a car alarm. But the sound grows, multiplies, becomes a chorus of terror rising from the streets below. You turn toward the floor-to-ceiling windows. Forty stories down, downtown has erupted into chaos. People running. Cars crashing. And something else. Something moving wrong, lurching, swarming.

Your phone buzzes. An encrypted message from Sarah Chen, your CTO.

Z-VIRUS OUTBREAK. GET TO THE UNDERGROUND LAB. ONLY CHANCE.

Z-Virus. You've heard whispers about GeneSys's black projects. Bioweapons disguised as research. You never believed them.

The boardroom door bursts open.

Derek stumbles in. Your CFO. The man who helped you build NanoGenix from nothing. But something is very wrong. Blood soaks his collar. His skin has gone gray. His eyes are vacant, filmed over with a milky sheen.

"Derek?" you manage.

He doesn't answer. His head snaps toward you, and a sound comes from his throat. Not words. A gurgling, hungry moan.

He lunges.

You have maybe two seconds. Behind you, the window overlooks the fire escape. Beside you, a heavy leather conference chair.
