"We end this now," you say. "If she releases 2.0, the cure won't matter."

Marcus grabs his gear without hesitation. "Let's move."

You race through the ruined city in Marcus's armored truck, the engine roaring through empty streets. The coordinates from Vex's files lead you deep into the industrial zone, past abandoned factories and collapsed warehouses. Finally, you spot it. A fortified entrance built into the side of a concrete bunker, barely visible behind rusted shipping containers. Heavy steel doors. Floodlights. And six mercenaries in tactical gear, weapons trained on the approach.

Marcus reaches into a duffel bag and pulls out two flash-bang grenades. "Military contacts came through," he says with a grim smile. "Cover your eyes."

The grenades arc through the air. Twin explosions of light and sound. The mercenaries stagger, disoriented, and you're both out of the truck before they can recover. Marcus moves like a ghost, precise and lethal. Six men down in as many seconds.

Inside, steel corridors lead deep underground, lit by humming fluorescent strips. The air tastes recycled, sterile. Your footsteps echo against the metal floor as you descend, following the bunker's layout from the stolen files.

Then you find her.

The control room is massive. Screens cover every wall, displaying feeds from cities across the country. New York. Chicago. Los Angeles. All burning. All dying. And at the center of it all stands Dr. Helena Vex.

Her lab coat is pristine. Spotless white against the chaos on the screens. She turns as you enter, and in her hand you see it. A vial of crimson liquid. Z-Virus 2.0.

"Too late," she smiles. Her finger hovers over a button on the console beside her. "One press, and the ventilation systems in every major city release my creation. Permanent infection. Irreversible. Humanity's next evolutionary step."

Marcus raises his rifle, sights locked on her head.

You hold the case of blue vials. The cure. Twenty doses that could change everything.

Vex's smile never wavers. "Choose wisely."
