"Forget the maps," you say. "Main tunnel. Faster."

Marcus hesitates. "Sarah marked these routes for a reason."

"We don't have time for detours."

You sprint down the central corridor, flashlight bouncing off grimy tiles and stagnant puddles. Marcus follows, reluctant but loyal. The moaning fades behind you. See? Nothing to worry about. Sometimes the direct path is the right one.

Then you round the corner.

Your flashlight beam catches them. Hundreds of infected, packed shoulder to shoulder in the tunnel ahead. Maybe thousands. A wall of gray flesh and empty eyes stretching back into the darkness. The collapse above must have driven them down here, funneling them into this single passage like cattle into a chute.

For one frozen second, nothing moves.

Then every head turns toward your light.

"Run!" Marcus shouts, opening fire.

His rifle barks. One infected drops. Two. But for every one that falls, ten more surge forward, climbing over the bodies of their fallen, a tide of rotting hands and snapping teeth.

You turn to flee, but they're faster than they look. The first one catches your ankle. You stumble. More pile on. Marcus empties his magazine, screaming your name, but there are simply too many.

Your last thought, as the darkness closes in, is of the cure. So close. Locked away in a lab that no one will ever reach now.

**THE END**
