You grab the conference chair and swing it hard. The floor-to-ceiling window explodes outward in a shower of glass. Wind tears at your suit as you kick out the remaining shards and climb through onto the fire escape.

Behind you, Derek lurches forward, hands grasping at empty air where you stood a second ago.

Don't look back. Just move.

The metal platform shudders under your weight. Forty stories up, the fire escape is old, rusted, probably not inspected since the building went up in the eighties. You grip the railing and start down, taking the steps two at a time.

Below, the streets are a nightmare. Hundreds of infected swarm through stalled traffic, pulling people from cars, crashing through storefronts. The sound of screaming and breaking glass rises like a wall of noise. You force yourself to focus on the metal under your feet.

Thirty-eighth floor. Thirty-seventh.

Rust flakes away under your palms. The bolts groan with every step.

Two floors down, you spot salvation. An open window leading into a darkened office. You could swing inside, get off this deathtrap, maybe find another way down through the building.

But then you see something else. At the bottom of the alley, a delivery van idles with its driver's door hanging open. Engine running. No driver in sight. Your ticket out of this chaos, if you can make it all the way down.

The fire escape groans again, louder this time. A bolt pops free and pings off into the void.
