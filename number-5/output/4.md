You don't trust the fire escape to hold much longer. Two floors down, the open window beckons.

You grip the railing, swing your legs over, and let go.

For a terrifying second you're falling, wind rushing past your ears. Then your hands catch the windowsill. Glass crunches beneath you as you haul yourself through, rolling across the floor of an abandoned office.

You scramble to your feet, brushing shards from your torn suit jacket. The room is chaos. Desks overturned. Papers scattered like fallen leaves. Coffee mugs shattered on the carpet. Whatever happened here, it happened fast.

Then you hear it. Shuffling. From the hallway.

Three figures emerge from the shadows. Office workers, still wearing their lanyards. One has a bluetooth headset dangling from her ear. Their skin is gray, their eyes clouded. They smell like copper and rot.

They heard you crash in. Now they're coming.

An emergency exit sign glows red at the corridor's end. Your way out. But between you and that door are three hungry corpses.

Your eyes dart to the desk beside you. A fire extinguisher. Heavy. Metal.

You grab it.

The first one lunges. You swing hard, putting every ounce of desperate strength behind it.

CRACK!

The extinguisher connects with its skull. It drops. The second one reaches for you. Another swing. Down. The third one trips over its fallen colleague, and you bring the extinguisher down like a hammer.

Silence.

You're breathing hard. Your arms are shaking. But you're alive.

You run for the exit, grab the handle, and push.

Nothing.

A small red light blinks beside a card reader. Keycard access only.

Footsteps echo from above. From below. More shuffling, more moaning. They heard the commotion. They're coming.

You look around frantically. Someone in this office had a keycard. They might have dropped it at their desk when they fled. Or they might still have it on their body, one of the three infected you just put down. Or you could forget the card entirely and use your improvised weapon to bash the door down.

The footsteps grow louder.
