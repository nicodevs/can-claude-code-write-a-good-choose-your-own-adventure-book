You punch the gas and merge onto the highway on-ramp.

Bad idea. Very bad idea.

The highway is a parking lot. Thousands of cars stretch ahead, brake lights glowing red in the dimming light. Some drivers abandoned their vehicles mid-lane, doors still open, engines still running. Others stayed, and you can see them pounding on their windows, screaming for help as infected swarm their cars.

You weave through the gridlock, clipping side mirrors, scraping paint. The van shudders with each impact. Ahead, a gap opens between an overturned semi and a police cruiser. You gun for it.

THUNK.

Something lands on your roof. Footsteps above you. Then a fist punches through the metal, gray fingers grasping blindly.

You swerve hard. The infected rolls off, tumbling under the wheels of a stalled SUV.

More are coming. They clamber over hoods and rooftops like a wave of flesh, drawn by the sound of your engine. A man in a torn business suit throws himself at your windshield. You don't slow down. Can't slow down.

Then you see it. Spotlights cutting through the chaos. Sandbags. Concrete barriers. Soldiers in tactical gear, rifles raised.

A military checkpoint.

They're waving cars through one at a time, checking each driver before letting them pass. Beyond the barricade, you glimpse the safe house district. Actual streets with power. Buildings with lights in the windows. Salvation.

A soldier steps into your lane and raises his hand. Stop.

You check your mirror. The infected are maybe fifty meters back and closing fast. A wave of gray flesh and snapping jaws.

The soldier gestures more urgently now. His partner raises a rifle.
