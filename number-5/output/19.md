"Let me through," you say, keeping your voice steady. "When I synthesize the cure, you get first doses. You and your people. Before anyone else."

The woman lowers the shotgun an inch. Behind you, the shuffling grows louder. You don't look back.

"How do we know you're good for it?" she asks.

You pull out your phone, show her your NanoGenix credentials. Your face on the company page. CEO. Co-founder of the nanotech platform that might just save the world.

"My name is right there. My lab is three miles east. I give you my word, and my word is all I have left." You hold her gaze. "You can shoot me, or you can let me try to fix this."

A long moment passes. The infected are close now. You can smell them.

She nods to the men behind her. "Move the trucks."

They scramble. The box trucks pull apart just enough for your van to squeeze through. As you pass her, she grabs your arm through the window.

"You better keep that promise," she says. Not a threat. A prayer.

"I will."

You make it to the lab district. You find Sarah's underground facility intact, her equipment operational. The work is grueling, sleepless days of synthesis and testing. But you do it. You create the cure.

And you keep your promise. The woman's group receives the first doses. Then their neighbors. Then entire blocks. The infection recedes like a tide going out.

But something is wrong.

Reports filter in of a new strain. More aggressive. Resistant to your cure. People you saved are getting sick again. Dying again. Rising again.

You never learned about Dr. Helena Vex. Never knew about her plan to release Z-Virus 2.0. Without Marcus Kane's intel, without understanding the true scope of GeneSys's conspiracy, you fought only half the war.

Your cure saves thousands. Maybe tens of thousands. The woman from the barricade survives. Her children survive. That matters.

But Vex releases her enhanced strain unopposed, and humanity's nightmare continues. Different now. Harder. Possibly unwinnable.

You did everything right. You just didn't know enough.

**THE END**
