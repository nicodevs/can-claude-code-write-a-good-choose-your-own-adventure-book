You brake hard. The van skids to a stop just meters from the barricade.

The soldier approaches, rifle leveled at your chest. Young. Maybe twenty-two. The kind of face that should be worrying about college exams, not the end of the world.

"Out of the vehicle," he barks. "Screening mandatory."

You roll down your window, hands raised. "Listen to me. I'm the CEO of NanoGenix. We have the technology to synthesize a cure. There's a lab, an underground facility. If I can just get there, I can stop all of this."

The soldier's expression doesn't change. "Everyone's got a story, buddy. Out. Now."

"You don't understand. Dr. Vex at GeneSys, she engineered this. And she's planning to release a second strain. If I don't reach my lab, millions more will die."

He gestures with his rifle toward a line of haggard civilians standing behind orange cones. "Get in line. You'll be screened like everyone else."

You glance back. The horde has reached the abandoned cars fifty meters behind you. They're crashing into vehicles, sniffing the air, searching. The noise of the checkpoint is drawing them closer.

"Please. I'm telling you the truth."

"Line. Now."

You comply. What choice do you have?

Ten minutes pass. Fifteen. The line barely moves. Ahead, soldiers argue over paperwork. Behind, the moaning grows louder.

When the horde hits, it hits all at once. A gray wave pouring over the barricade's flanks. Soldiers open fire, but there are hundreds of them, thousands, an endless tide of hunger.

You try to run. Everyone does.

It doesn't matter.

**THE END**
