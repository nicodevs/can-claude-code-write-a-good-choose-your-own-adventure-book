Three days.

The water cooler ran dry yesterday. Your phone battery died the day before that. You've eaten nothing but stale mints from the welcome tray and a protein bar you found in Hartwell's briefcase. He won't be needing it.

Your body aches. Your vision swims when you stand too fast. The city outside has gone quiet. No more helicopters. No more gunfire. Just smoke drifting between empty buildings.

You press your ear to the door. Nothing.

It takes the last of your strength to shove the conference table aside. The hallway beyond is dark. Emergency lights flicker, casting red shadows on walls smeared with handprints. The elevator lobby reeks of copper and rot.

You take one step. Two. Your legs tremble beneath you.

Then you see them. A dozen figures slumped in the shadows. They weren't moving, so you thought they were dead. They aren't dead.

Milky eyes snap open. Heads turn in unison.

You try to run, but three days without food has left you hollow. You stumble. Fall.

They don't.

Turns out waiting for rescue was a solid plan. If only rescue had come.

**THE END**
