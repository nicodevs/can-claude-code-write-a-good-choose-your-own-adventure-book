You pull out your phone and scroll to Sarah's encrypted maps. The screen glows faintly in the darkness, revealing a web of maintenance passages and service tunnels that bypass the main subway lines entirely.

"This way," you whisper, pointing to a rusted service door half-hidden behind a collapsed pillar.

Marcus covers you while you work the lock. The mechanism is ancient, corroded, but Derek's executive access card still carries emergency override authority. A red light flickers to green. The door groans open.

The passage beyond is tight. Barely wide enough for shoulders. Pipes run along the ceiling, dripping condensation that reeks of copper and mold. You squeeze through first, Marcus close behind, weapons pressed flat against your bodies.

The walls feel like they're closing in.

Keep moving. Don't think about it.

The tunnel winds and branches, but Sarah's maps guide you true. Past junction boxes sparking with exposed wires. Under a collapsed beam that forces you to crawl on hands and knees through three inches of stagnant water. Through a forgotten maintenance hub where rats scatter at your approach.

Then you emerge onto an abandoned platform. Dust covers everything. The tiles are cracked, the benches rusted. This station was sealed off decades ago. Nobody comes here.

Nobody except you.

Across the platform, partially hidden behind a bank of dead vending machines, stands a nondescript door. No sign. No markings. Just a small biometric scanner beside the handle, its green light pulsing steadily.

Your lab's emergency entrance.

You cross the platform, glass crunching under your feet, and press your palm to the scanner. It hums, reading your prints, your pulse, the unique electrical signature of your skin.

IDENTITY CONFIRMED.

The door clicks open.

Inside, the facility hums with backup power. Emergency lights cast a soft blue glow across rows of pristine equipment. Workstations. Centrifuges. And there, in the center of the room, Sarah's nanotech assembler. The machine that could save the world. Untouched. Waiting.

All her research. Everything you need. Right here.

Marcus sweeps the perimeter, checking corners, peering through doorways. "Facility's clear," he reports, returning to your side. "But we made noise getting here. Infected will follow eventually." He checks his watch. "I give us maybe an hour before they find us."

One hour to save humanity.

You approach the assembler. The interface glows to life at your touch, displaying Sarah's last project files. The cure formula is there, complete, ready for synthesis. But a warning flashes at the bottom of the screen.

ESTIMATED PRODUCTION TIME: 47 MINUTES (STANDARD PROTOCOL)

Or you could modify the parameters. Push the machine harder. Cut corners on quality control. Get the cure out in half the time. But rush the process, and you risk contamination. Instability. A cure that might not work at all. Or worse.

Marcus watches you. "What's it gonna be, boss?"

- _If you modify the formula to increase production speed despite safety risks, turn to [page 28](./28.md)_
