You grab the massive conference table and shove it toward the door. Derek slams into it, his gray fingers clawing at the polished mahogany, nails scraping furrows into the wood. The investors scatter, screaming, but you don't have time to worry about them. They bolt through a side door. You're alone.

The table holds. Derek snarls and pounds against it, his head jerking in that wrong, broken way. You pull out your phone and dial 911.

Busy signal.

You try again. Busy. Busy. Busy.

There's a military emergency line you memorized from a disaster preparedness seminar. You punch it in with shaking fingers.

"Due to the citywide evacuation order, all personnel have been deployed to priority zones. Please proceed to your nearest designated shelter."

The recording loops. You hang up.

Hours pass. Derek eventually loses interest. You hear him shuffling away, drawn by some sound you can't identify. Other infected wander past the boardroom. Their shadows pass beneath the door. You hold your breath each time.

Night falls. The city burns.

From forty stories up, you watch helicopters buzz over distant rooftops. Military convoys crawl through streets clogged with abandoned cars. None of them come for you. No one even looks up.

You are alone in the boardroom. Surrounded by leather chairs, crystal decanters, and a presentation about saving the world.

No rescue comes.
