You've survived this long by being smart. Charging into the unknown alone would be stupid.

The military safe zone is three blocks east, according to the painted signs spray-painted on buildings. You weave the motorcycle through stalled traffic and scattered corpses until you reach it.

A fortified barricade blocks the street. Sandbags, razor wire, two Humvees with mounted guns. Soldiers in tactical gear wave you down, weapons raised.

"Civilian! Stop the vehicle!"

You kill the engine and raise your hands. "I'm the CEO of NanoGenix. We have the technology to create a cure."

A grizzled man steps forward. Colonel Rivera, according to his insignia. His eyes are bloodshot. Exhausted. Desperate. But skeptical too.

"Everyone's got a cure," he says flatly. "Talk is cheap."

"I have a lab. Underground. Fully equipped nanotech synthesis platform. I just need help getting there."

Rivera studies you for a long moment. Then he nods to two soldiers. "Martinez. Okonkwo. Escort this person. If they're lying, shoot them."

They're not gentle, but they're effective. The two soldiers clear a path through the infested streets with ruthless efficiency. By nightfall, you reach the NanoGenix lab.

The synthesis takes twelve hours. You work through the night, calibrating dosages, running simulations, praying the equipment holds. By dawn, you have it. A cure.

Rivera distributes it to the safe zones. Thousands are saved. Thousands more follow. For a week, it feels like humanity might actually win.

Then the second wave hits.

A new strain. Faster. Stronger. Completely resistant to your cure.

Z-Virus 2.0.

Without Marcus Kane, without intel on GeneSys, you never learned about Dr. Helena Vex. Never discovered her plan. Never had a chance to stop it.

The enhanced strain tears through the safe zones like wildfire. Rivera evacuates who he can. A helicopter carries you to a remote island with three hundred other survivors.

You saved some. Not enough. The world you knew is gone.

On clear nights, you stand on the shore and watch the distant mainland burn. You wonder if Vex is still out there, proud of her work. You wonder if Sarah made it. You wonder if there was another path, another choice that might have changed everything.

But wondering doesn't bring back the dead.

**THE END**
