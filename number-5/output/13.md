You race down the shaking fire escape, your dress shoes slipping on rusted metal. Every step feels like the whole structure might tear free from the wall. Don't think. Just move.

Another bolt pops. The platform tilts.

You swing over the railing and drop the last six feet, landing hard on cracked asphalt. Pain shoots up through your ankles, but you're already moving, pulling open the van's driver door.

Empty. Keys in the ignition. Engine rumbling. Wherever the driver went, he's not coming back.

You throw yourself inside and slam the door just as the first infected rounds the corner. A woman in a business suit, her face torn, her movements jerky and wrong. She slams against the window, smearing blood across the glass. More appear behind her. Five. Ten. A crowd of them pouring into the alley.

You jam the van into drive and floor it.

The vehicle lurches forward, clipping a dumpster as you careen out of the alley and onto the main street. And that's when you see it. The full scope of the nightmare.

Abandoned cars everywhere, some still running, doors hanging open. A city bus on its side, flames licking from the windows. Bodies in the street, some moving, some not. The ones that are moving are hunting the ones that are running.

Your phone's GPS flickers to life. Two routes to Sarah's underground lab appear on the screen.

The highway north cuts straight through downtown. Faster, if it's clear. Big if.

The surface streets east wind through the warehouse district. Longer route, but maybe fewer people means fewer infected.

In the rearview mirror, the horde spills out of the alley behind you.
