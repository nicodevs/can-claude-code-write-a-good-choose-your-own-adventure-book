Title: DEADZONE CEO
Description: You're the CEO of NanoGenix, a biotech startup with revolutionary cure technology, presenting to investors when the zombie apocalypse hits downtown. The outbreak was engineered by Dr. Helena Vex, your rival at GeneSys, who created the Z-Virus as a twisted population control experiment. Now she's planning to release Z-Virus 2.0, an unstoppable version that will make the infection permanent. Your company's underground lab holds the only equipment capable of synthesizing a cure.

The fate of humanity rests on your startup technology.
